        "description": "Understanding instead of lamenting the popularity of self-help books Based on a reading of more than three hundred self-help books, Sandra K. Dolby examines this remarkably popular genre to define \"self-help\" in a way that's compelling to academics and lay readers alike. Self-Help Books also offers an interpretation of why these books are so popular, arguing that they continue the well-established American penchant for self-education, they articulate problems of daily life and their supposed solutions, and that they present their content in a form and style that is accessible rather than arcane. Using tools associated with folklore studies, Dolby then examines how the genre makes use of stories, aphorisms, and a worldview that is at once traditional and contemporary. The overarching premise of the study is that self-help books, much like fairy tales, take traditional materials, especially stories and ideas, and recast them into extended essays that people happily read, think about, try to apply, and then set aside when a new embodiment of the genre comes along.",

        "description": "Samuel Beckett as a guru for business executives? James Joyce as a guide to living a good life? The notion of notoriously experimental authors sharing a shelf with self-help books might seem far-fetched, yet a hidden history of rivalry, influence, and imitation links these two worlds. In The Self-Help Compulsion, Beth Blum reveals the profound entanglement of modern literature and commercial advice from the late nineteenth century to the present day. Blum explores popular reading practices in which people turn to literature in search of practical advice alongside modern writers\u2019 rebukes of such instrumental purposes. As literary authors positioned themselves in opposition to people like Samuel Smiles and Dale Carnegie, readers turned to self-help for the promises of mobility, agency, and practical use that serious literature was reluctant to supply. Blum unearths a series of unlikely cases of the love-hate relationship between serious fiction and commercial advice, from Gustave Flaubert\u2019s mockery of early DIY culture to Dear Abby\u2019s cutting diagnoses of Nathanael West and from Virginia Woolf\u2019s ambivalent polemics against self-improvement to the ways that contemporary global authors such as Mohsin Hamid and Tash Aw explicitly draw on the self-help genre. She also traces the self-help industry\u2019s tendency to popularize, quote, and adapt literary wisdom and considers what it might have to teach today\u2019s university. Offering a new history of self-help\u2019s origins, appeal, and cultural and literary import around the world, this book reveals that self-help\u2019s most valuable secrets are not about getting rich or winning friends but about how and why people read.",

        "description": "Self-help materials have become a prime source of psychological advice for millions of Americans. While many self-help resources provide high-quality information and support, others may be misleading, inaccurate, or even harmful. This indispensable volume reveals which are the good ones, which are the bad ones, and why. Based on the results of 5 national studies involving over 2,500 mental health professionals, the book reviews and rates 600+ self-help books, autobiographies, and popular films. In addition, hundreds of helpful Internet sites are described and evaluated by a clinical psychologist, and valuable listings are provided of national and online support groups. The concluding chapter presents practical guidelines for selecting an effective self-help resource. Addressing 28 of the most prevalent clinical disorders and life challenges--from ADHD, Alzheimer's, and anxiety disorders, to marital problems and mood disorders, to weight management and women's issues--this timely book will be tremendously useful to consumers and professionals alike.",

Then, one day, she woke up to find that the life she hoped for and the life she was living were worlds apart\u2014and she set out to make some big changes. Marianne decided to finally find out if her elusive \u201cperfect existence\u201d \u2014the one without debt, anxiety, or hangover Netflix marathons, the one where she healthily bounced around town and met the cashmere-sweater-wearing man of her dreams\u2014really did lie in the pages of our best known and acclaimed self-help books. She vowed to test a book a month for one year, following its advice to the letter, taking what she hoped would be the surest path to a flawless new her. But as the months passed and Marianne\u2019s reality was turned upside down, she found herself confronted with a different question: Self-help can change your life, but is it for the better? With humor, audacity, disarming candor and unassuming wisdom, in Help Me Marianne Power plumbs the trials and tests of being a modern woman in a \u201chave it all\u201d culture, and what it really means to be our very best selves. \u201cEqual parts touching and hilarious, Power\u2019s account of the year she spent following the tenets of self-help books will make you feel better about your own flawed life.\u201d \u2014People",
