There were the proud, cultivated, and degenerate Sforzas in Milan, and in Rome, the corrupt Spanish family of the Borgia whose head, Rodrigo, ascended to St Peter's throne as Pope Alexander VI. In Florence, a golden age of culture and sophistication ended with the death of the greatest of the Medici family, Lorenzo the Magnificent, giving way to an era of uncertainty, cruelty, and religious fundamentalism.

In the midst of this turmoil, there existed the greatest concentration of artists that Europe has ever known. Influenced by the rediscovery of the ancient cultures of Greece and Rome, artists and thinkers such as Botticelli and da Vinci threw off the shackles of the Middle Ages to produce one of the most creative periods in history - the Renaissance.

This is the story of twelve years when war, plague, famine, and chaos made their mark on a volatile Italy, and when a young, erratic genius, Michelangelo Buonarroti, made his first great statue - the David. It was to become a symbol not only of the independence and defiance of the city of Florence but also of the tortured soul who created it. This is a wonderful history of the artist, his times, and one of his most magnificent works.","[""Art"",""History"",""Art History"",""Italy"",""Biography"",""Nonfiction""]",1/28/2002,2002.0,"{""name"":""Anton Gill"",""num_books"":57,""num_followers"":""60""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":2,""reviews_percentage"":2},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":9,""reviews_percentage"":10},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":35,""reviews_percentage"":41},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":26,""reviews_percentage"":30},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":13,""reviews_percentage"":15}}","""$11.99""",external,external_focus,True

The arrest in her sleepy northern California town kicked off what would become one of the most captivating murder trials in recent memory, as police, local attorneys, and the national media sought to unravel the complex web of events that sent this seemingly devoted housewife over the edge.

Now, with the exclusive access and in-depth reporting that made A Deadly Game a number one New York Times bestseller, Catherine Crier turns an analytical eye to the story of Susan Polk, delving into her past and examining how over twenty years of marriage culminated in murder. Tracing the family's history, Crier skillfully maneuvers the murky waters of the Polk's marriage, looking at the real story behind Susan, Felix, and their unorthodox courtship. When Susan was in high school, Felix, who was more than twenty years her senior, had been her psychologist, and it was during their sessions that the romantic entanglement began. From these troubling origins grew a difficult marriage, one which produced three healthy boys but also led to disturbing accusations of abuse from both spouses.

With extraordinary detail, Crier dissects this dangerous relationship between husband and wife, exposing their psychological motivations and the painful impact that these motivations had on their sons, Adam, Eli, and Gabriel. Drawing on sources from all sides of the case, Crier masterfully reconstructs the tumultuous chronology of the Polk family, telling the story of how Susan and Felix struggled to control their rambunctious sons and their disintegrating marriage in the years and months leading up to Felix's death.

But the history of the Polk family is only half the story. Here Crier also elucidates the methodical police work of the murder investigation, revealing never-before-seen photos and writings from the case file. In addition, she carefully scrutinizes the many twists and turns of the remarkable trial, exploring Susan's struggles with her defense attorneys and her shocking decision to represent herself.

Dark, psychological, and terrifying, Final Analysis is a harrowing look at the recesses of the human mind and the trauma that reveals them.","[""True Crime"",""Nonfiction"",""Crime"",""Mystery"",""History"",""Audiobook""]",1/1/2007,2007.0,"{""name"":""Catherine Crier"",""num_books"":10,""num_followers"":""95""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":31,""reviews_percentage"":6},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":53,""reviews_percentage"":11},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":177,""reviews_percentage"":37},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":131,""reviews_percentage"":27},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":83,""reviews_percentage"":17}}","""$4.99""",external,internal_focus,True

The Regulator Rebellion of 1766-71 pitted thousands of farmers, many of them religious radicals inspired by the Great Awakening, against political and economic elites who opposed the Regulators' proposed reforms. The conflict culminated on May 16, 1771, when a colonial militia defeated more than 2,000 armed farmers in a pitched battle near Hillsborough. At least 6,000 Regulators and sympathizers were forced to swear their allegiance to the government as the victorious troops undertook a punitive march through Regulator settlements. Seven farmers were hanged.

Using sources that include diaries, church minutes, legal papers, and the richly detailed accounts of the Regulators themselves, Marjoleine Kars delves deeply into the world and ideology of free rural colonists. She examines the rebellion's economic, religious, and political roots and explores its legacy in North Carolina and beyond.

Smith""]",3.79,63,11.0,"In 1971, a man known as DB Cooper hijacked a Northwest Orient airliner flying from Portland, Oregon to Seattle, Washington. After exchanging the passengers at SEA-TAC airport for $200,000 and four parachutes, Cooper instructed the pilots to fly him to ""anywhere in Mexico.” A few minutes after take-off, he lowered the aft staircase and jumped into the chilly, rainy night skies north of Portland.He has never been seen since, and his identity is still unknown. After forty years of investigation the FBI still doesn’t know who Cooper was or if he survived, and nothing has ever been found of the skyjacking—no parachutes, no body or clothes, nor any of the money, except for $5,800 a young boy found eight years later buried on a Columbia River beach. Adding to the intrigue, no one knows how the money got there or when.As a result, it is as if Cooper came from nowhere and returned there when he made his getaway.Now after years of research and writing, a comprehensive case history of the skyjacking is available, and the reader can examine the facts of the case, and assess the FBI's efforts to find DB Cooper. Shockingly, the Bureau’s investigation has been crippled by lost evidence, inaccurate record-keeping, and ineffective leadership. As we learned in 9-11, the FBI has difficulty ""connecting the dots"" in complicated investigations that span multiple jurisdictions, and the same is true with DB Cooper.For example: the FBI gave DB Cooper a 40-hour head start before anyone went looking for him in the woods of southeast Washington State. More troubling, critical evidence has been lost—the eight cigarette butts Cooper left on the plane, which would give us his DNA profile via the dried saliva. Perhaps more disturbing, though, the cigarette butts went missing after their true value was realized in 2002, along with the documentation on the FBI's findings.In addition, the FBI’s chief technical expert, Earl Cossey, was murdered in 2013 when his credibility plummeted as Internet sleuths revealed his fraudulent and deceptive history, and how the FBI was duped. Or was it?But this book is more than a true-crime thriller. ""DB Cooper and the FBI"" reveals how law enforcement truly functions in our country, and so it delivers a measure of justice to the arrogant, the hubristic, and the guilty.","[""Nonfiction"",""True Crime"",""History""]",3/17/2015,2015.0,"{""name"":""Bruce A.

In November 2001, the body of a young doctor named Andrew Bagby was discovered in Keystone State Park outside Latrobe, Pennsylvania, five bullet wounds in his face, chest, buttocks, and the back of the head. For parents Dave and Kate, the pain was unbearable―but Andrew’s murder was only the first in a string of tragic events.


The chief suspect for Andrew’s murder was his ex-girlfriend Shirley Turner―also a doctor. Obsessive and unstable, Shirley Turner lied to the police and fled to her family home in Newfoundland before she could be arrested. While fending off extradition efforts by U.S. law enforcement, she announced she was pregnant with Andrew's son, Zachary. The Bagbys―hoping to gain custody of Zachary―moved to Newfoundland and began a long, drawn-out battle in court and with Canadian social services to protect their grandson from the woman who had almost certainly murdered their son. Then, in August 2003, Shirley Turner killed herself and the one-year-old Zachary by jumping into the Atlantic Ocean.

After considering his environment, personality, and early thought, it carefully takes readers through his best-known work, Being and Time. Heidegger concludes with highlights of its subject's later thought, providing guidelines for understanding Contributions to Philosophy and other important texts.

Or of the cold beef eaten by Willoughby on his journey of repentance to see Marianne? Why is it so appropriate that the scene of Emma's disgrace should be a picnic, and how do the different styles of housekeeping in Mansfield Park engage with the social issues of the day?

While Jane Austen does not luxuriate in cataloguing meals in the way of Victorian novelists, food in fact plays a vital part in her novels. Her plots, being domestic, are deeply imbued with the rituals of giving and sharing meals. The attitudes of her characters to eating, to housekeeping and to hospitality are important indicators of their moral worth. In a practice both economical and poetic, Jane Austen sometimes uses specific foodstuffs to symbolise certain qualities at heightened moments in the text. This culminates in the artistic triumph of Emma, in which repeated references to food not only contribute to the solidity of her imagined world, but provide an extended metaphor for the interdependence of a community.

In this original, lively and well-researched book, Maggie Lane not only offers a fresh perspective on the novels, but illuminates a fascinating period of food history, as England stood on the brink of urbanisation, middle-class luxury, and change in the role of women. Ranging over topics from greed and gender to mealtimes and manners, and drawing on the novels, letters and Austen family papers, she also discusses Jane Austen's own ambivalent attitude to the provision and enjoyment of food.","[""Nonfiction"",""History"",""Food"",""Regency"",""British Literature"",""Historical"",""Cooking"",""Research""]",7/1/1995,1995.0,"{""name"":""Maggie Lane"",""num_books"":49,""num_followers"":""14""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":6,""reviews_percentage"":2},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":12,""reviews_percentage"":4},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":58,""reviews_percentage"":23},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":92,""reviews_percentage"":38},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":74,""reviews_percentage"":30}}","""$3.99""",external,external_focus,True

The book you are about to read, a manual of Yoga taught by Gheranda to Chanda, is the most encyclopedic of all the root texts of Hatha Yoga. At the beginning of the book, Chanda asks Gheranda to tell him about the Yoga of the body, which is the cause of knowledge of the Ultimate Reality. Gheranda assents and the book is thus called the Gheranda Samhita, or ""The Collection [of Verses] of Gheranda."" It sets itself apart from other books on Hatha Yoga in two notable ways. Firstly, it calls its Yoga ""ghata Yoga"" or ""ghatastha Yoga"" and not Hatha Yoga. The usual meaning of ghata is ""pot,"" but here it refers to the body, or rather the person, since the techniques taught by Gheranda work on both the body and the mind. Secondly, it is unique in teaching a sevenfold path to perfection of the person. Excerpt
The yogi should visualize a sublime ocean of nectar in his heart, with an island of jewels in its middle whose sand is made of gemstones.

When acclaimed memoirist and scholar Louise DeSalvo sold the house she and her husband had raised their children in and moved to a beautiful new home in Montclair, New Jersey, she was shocked to discover a rash of unexpected emotions interfering with her plans. Suddenly the old, cramped house was paradise, and the new house a barren building with none of the comforts or familiarity of “home.” Faced with a sudden disillusionment over her dream house, DeSalvo turned, as she always has, to her favorite writers.
What she found was a treasure trove of material, most of which has seldom been written about before, chronicling the tumultuous and inspiring moves of some of our most beloved literary figures. Percy Shelley, destitute and restless, moved his tired family from one home to another, only to settle in what he came to believe was a haunted house on the Gulf of Spezia (in which he soon drowned). Virginia Woolf, on her hunt for the perfect room of her own, was a real estate hound, and spent years trying to get back to her home in London after a nervous breakdown forced her to relocate to the country. More recently, Mark Doty found selling the house he and his dying lover had spent decades renovating surprisingly freeing as the couple found a new home in which to say goodbye.
DeSalvo discovers that the pain, hope, and turmoil involved in moving have been universal for generations. On Moving mines the hopes, disappointments, memories, and fears that come with that simple yet fundamental part of everyone’s lives: moving.","[""Nonfiction"",""Writing"",""Memoir"",""Essays"",""Books About Books"",""Biography"",""Psychology"",""Biography Memoir""]",1/1/2009,2009.0,"{""name"":""Louise DeSalvo"",""num_books"":32,""num_followers"":""68""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":0,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":6,""reviews_percentage"":7},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":30,""reviews_percentage"":37},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":25,""reviews_percentage"":31},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":19,""reviews_percentage"":23}}","""$9.99""",external,external_focus,True

Nizam lives in a village near the rainforest preserve surrounding PeduLake, just below the Thai border in Peninsular Malaysia. His grandfather Pak-Teh is the leader of the honey hunting clan. It is Pak-Teh who has the high honor of climbing the tall Tualang tree in the annual hunt to gather honey from the nests of giant honey bees. But Pak-Teh is getting older and is now ready to prepare someone to take his place. He believes that Nizam is the one. Even though Nizam has climbed the mighty Tualang—the bee tree—in the daylight, he has never done it at night. Will he be brave enough? On the first moonless night of the honey hunt, Nizam and Pak-Teh and the other honey hunters enter the dark rainforest. Pak-Teh starts the hunt with a prayer and a traditional story. Then he begins to climb. Nizam follows. Can he climb that high and not be afraid? Will the angry bees sting him? At the top, Nizam and Pak-Teh use the honey hunters’ secret to keep from being stung, while their clansmen below soothe the bees with chanting. After a week of gathering honey in the nights, the clan returns home to celebrate their sweet and miraculous golden harvest. At this feast, Pak-Teh honors Nizam with an important announcement.

In an accessible, conversational format, Cornel West, with distinguished scholar Christa Buschendorf, provides a fresh perspective on six revolutionary African American  Frederick Douglass, W. E. B. Du Bois, Martin Luther King Jr., Ella Baker, Malcolm X, and Ida B. Wells. In dialogue with Buschendorf, West examines the impact of these men and women on their own eras and across the decades. He not only rediscovers the integrity and commitment within these passionate advocates but also their fault lines.
 
West, in these illuminating conversations with the German scholar and thinker Christa Buschendorf, describes Douglass as a complex man who is both “ the towering Black freedom fighter of the nineteenth century” and a product of his time who lost sight of the fight for civil rights after the emancipation. He calls Du Bois “undeniably the most important Black intellectual of the twentieth century” and explores the more radical aspects of his thinking in order to understand his uncompromising critique of the United States, which has been omitted from the American collective memory. West argues that our selective memory has sanitized and even “Santaclausified” Martin Luther King Jr., rendering him less radical, and has marginalized Ella Baker, who embodies the grassroots organizing of the civil rights movement. The controversial Malcolm X, who is often seen as a proponent of reverse racism, hatred, and violence, has been demonized in a false opposition with King, while the appeal of his rhetoric and sincerity to students has been sidelined. Ida B. Wells, West argues, shares Malcolm X’s radical spirit and fearless speech, but has “often become the victim of public amnesia.”
 
By providing new insights that humanize all of these well-known figures, in the engrossing dialogue with Buschendorf, and in his insightful introduction and powerful closing essay, Cornel West takes an important step in rekindling the Black prophetic fire so essential in the age of Obama.","[""History"",""Race"",""Nonfiction"",""Politics"",""Social Justice"",""Philosophy"",""African American"",""Biography"",""Cultural"",""Theology""]",1/1/2014,2014.0,"{""name"":""Cornel West"",""num_books"":140,""num_followers"":""1178""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":6,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":13,""reviews_percentage"":3},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":58,""reviews_percentage"":15},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":133,""reviews_percentage"":36},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":157,""reviews_percentage"":42}}","""$13.99""",external,internal_focus,True

Two years later she was killed by American forces not far from where she worked. Written between 1968 and 1970, her diary speaks poignantly of her devotion to family and friends, the horrors of war, her yearning for her high school sweetheart, and her struggle to prove her loyalty to her country. At times raw, at times lyrical and youthfully sentimental, her voice transcends cultures to speak of her dignity and compassion and of her challenges in the face of the war’s ceaseless fury.

The American officer who discovered the diary soon after Dr. Tram’s death was under standing orders to destroy all documents without military value. As he was about to toss it into the flames, his Vietnamese translator said to him, “Don’t burn this one. . . . It has fire in it already.” Against regulations, the officer preserved the diary and kept it for thirty-five years. In the spring of 2005, a copy made its way to Dr. Tram’s elderly mother in Hanoi. The diary was soon published in Vietnam, causing a national sensation. Never before had there been such a vivid and personal account of the long ordeal that had consumed the nation’s previous generations.

Translated by Andrew X. Pham and with an introduction by Pulitzer Prize winner Frances FitzGerald, Last Night I Dreamed of Peace is an extraordinary document that narrates one woman’s personal and political struggles.

Her analysis of how human communities are related to their environment opens a perspective that goes beyond overt changes in the landscape. Merchant brings to light the dense network of links between the human realm of economic regimes, social structure, and gender relations, as they are conditioned by a dominant worldview, and the ecological realm of plant and animal life. Thus we see how the integration of the Indians with their natural world was shattered by Europeans who engaged in exhaustive methods of hunting, trapping, and logging for the market and in widespread subsistence farming. The resulting ""colonial ecological revolution"" was to hold sway until roughly the time of American independence, when the onset of industrialization and increasing urbanization brought about the ""capitalist ecological revolution."" By the late nineteenth century, Merchant argues, New England had become a society that viewed the whole ecosphere as an arena for human domination. One can see in New England a ""mirror of the world,"" she says. What took place there between 1600 and 1850 was a greatly accelerated recapitulation of the evolutionary ecological changes that had occurred in Europe over a span of 2,500 years.","[""History"",""American History"",""Feminism"",""Ecology"",""Nonfiction"",""Science"",""History Of Science"",""Environment"",""Nature"",""Gender""]",1/1/1989,1989.0,"{""name"":""Carolyn Merchant"",""num_books"":28,""num_followers"":""26""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":4,""reviews_percentage"":5},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":9,""reviews_percentage"":13},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":29,""reviews_percentage"":43},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":24,""reviews_percentage"":35}}","""$29.99""",external,external_focus,True

While one side originated in the traditional idea of republican virtue, the other emerged from the counterculture of the late 1960s and has become the dominant culture of today.In clear and vigorous prose, Himmelfarb argues that while the dominant culture pervades journalism, academia, television, and film, a ""dissident culture"" continues to promote the values of family, a civil society, sexual morality, privacy, and patriotism. The clash between these two cultures affects all areas of American society.Despite her forceful critique, Himmelfarb sees encouraging signs for the future of American culture. She explores the place of religion, family, and the law in American life and proposes democratic remedies for the nation's moral and cultural diseases. Though there are many legitimate grievances against government, she contends, our citizenry cannot afford to delegitimize it.

At first the discussion was detached; Mr. Manchester was writing his Portrait of a President. But soon they were conversing as two men do who have lived many of the same years in the same places. Both were natives of Massachusetts. As a World War II Marine on Guadalcanal, Manchester had been separated by only a narrow strait from Kennedy's PT-109 base on Tulagi. They had both been awarded Purple Hearts before leaving the Pacific. Now they were fathers of daughters the same age, had traveled in the same foreign countries, and shared a deep interest in American history.More than two years later, following the assassination of President Kennedy, Mrs. Kennedy realized that she and others would be obliged to share their recollections of the national tragedy with a responsible writer--and so she and Senator Robert Kennedy asked Mr. Manchester to set down a history of the assassination and the days immediately preceding and following it.At the invitation of the Chief Justice, Mr. Manchester was a privileged observer of the Warren Commission inquiry. Meanwhile, however, he had developed his own sources of information. Operating out of headquarters in the National Archives, for two years he worked twelve to fifteen hours a day, conducting a major historical investigation throughout Texas and elsewhere, accumulating forty-five volumes and portfolios of transcribed tapes, shorthand, documents and exhibits, all of which will be deposited in the Kennedy Library. Finally, in New England, he completed a 350,000-word manuscript, not for scrutiny by the family but to set down as a whole the national and personal tragedy.The result is a powerful narrative which, in the opinion of the publisher, is both a significant contribution to history and an eminent literary achievement.","[""History"",""Nonfiction"",""Politics"",""American History"",""Biography"",""Presidents"",""True Crime"",""Us Presidents"",""Historical"",""American""]",1/1/1967,1967.0,"{""name"":""William Manchester"",""num_books"":106,""num_followers"":""501""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":66,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":129,""reviews_percentage"":2},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":604,""reviews_percentage"":13},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1431,""reviews_percentage"":32},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":2135,""reviews_percentage"":48}}","""$13.99""",external,external_focus,True

What is communism? Where did the idea come from and what attracted people to it? Is there a future for communism? This Very Short Introduction considers these questions and more in the search to explore and understand this controversial political force. Explaining the theory behind its ideology, and examining the history and mindset behind its political, economic and social structures, Leslie Holmes considers the evolution of communism from Marx's time, to its practice in the Bolshevik Revolution, to its collapse in 1989-91. Holmes highlights the inner dynamics, crises, and demise of communism as a global system, and introduces the major players in the
communist world, including Marx, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao.

About the Series : Combining authority with wit, accessibility, and style, Very Short Introductions offer an introduction to some of life's most interesting topics.

Spearheaded by David Bowie, Alice Cooper, T. Rex, and Roxy Music, glam rock reveled in artifice and spectacle. Reacting against the hairy, denim-clad rock bands of the late Sixties, glam was the first true teenage rampage of the new decade. In Shock and Awe, Simon Reynolds takes the reader on a wild cultural tour through the early Seventies, a period packed with glitzy costumes and alien make-up, thrilling music and larger-than-life personas.

Shock and Awe offers a fresh, in-depth look at the glam and glitter phenomenon, placing it the wider Seventies context of social upheaval and political disillusion. It explores how artists like Lou Reed, New York Dolls and Queen broke with the hippie generation, celebrating illusion and artifice over truth and authenticity. Probing the genre’s major themes—stardom, androgyny, image, decadence, fandom, apocalypse—Reynolds tracks glam’s legacy as it unfolded in subsequent decades, from Eighties art-pop icons like Kate Bush through to twenty-first century idols of outrage such as Lady Gaga. 

Shock and Awe shows how the original glam artists’ obsessions with fame, extreme fashion, and theatrical excess continue to reverberate through contemporary pop culture.","[""Music"",""Nonfiction"",""History"",""Pop Culture"",""Biography"",""Rock N Roll"",""Cultural"",""Art"",""Reference"",""Audiobook""]",10/6/2016,2016.0,"{""name"":""Simon Reynolds"",""num_books"":45,""num_followers"":""424""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":3,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":23,""reviews_percentage"":3},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":156,""reviews_percentage"":22},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":311,""reviews_percentage"":44},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":202,""reviews_percentage"":29}}","""$9.99""",external,external_focus,True

Unii au stiut exact ce vor, in vreme ce altii s-au vazut zvarliti de vreo furtuna pe-un tarm oarecare si, in lipsa de optiuni rezonabile, au hotarat sa-si construiasca pana una-alta un adapost. Niciunul dintre cei despre care veti citi nu a avut, la inceput de poveste, cine-stie-ce capital de pornire. Toti au luat-o de jos si foarte jos - de la venituri care in cel mai bun caz ajungeau de la o luna la alta, de la o pravalie de cativa metri patrati, de la o taraba, de la compania de la noi din sufragerie. Niciunul n-avea habar, cand a pornit, cum se fac afacerile. Au inceput fara mentori care sa-i fereasca de decizii gresite, fara MBA-uri, fara carti de afaceri pe noptiera.

Before they teamed up, Dean Martin seemed destined for a mediocre career as a nightclub singer, and Jerry Lewis was dressing up as Carmen Miranda and miming records on stage. But the moment they got together, something clicked—something miraculous—and audiences saw it at once. 

Before long, they were as big as Elvis or the Beatles would be after them, creating hysteria wherever they went and grabbing an unprecedented hold over every entertainment outlet of the era: radio, television, movies, stage shows, and nightclubs. Martin and Lewis were a national craze, an American institution. The millions (and the women) flowed in, seemingly without end—and then, on July 24, 1956, ten years from the day when the two men joined forces, it all ended.

After that traumatic day, the two wouldn’t speak again for twenty years. And while both went on to forge triumphant individual careers—Martin as a movie and television star, recording artist, and nightclub luminary (and charter member of the Rat Pack); Lewis as the groundbreaking writer, producer, director, and star of a series of hugely successful movie comedies—their parting left a hole in the national psyche, as well as in each man’s heart.

In a memoir by turns moving, tragic, and hilarious, Jerry Lewis recounts with crystal clarity every step of a fifty-year friendship, from the springtime, 1945 afternoon when the two vibrant young performers destined to conquer the world together met on Broadway and Fifty-fourth Street, to their tragic final encounter in the 1990s, when Lewis and his wife ran into Dean Martin, a broken and haunted old man.

In Dean and Me, Jerry Lewis makes a convincing case for Dean Martin as one of the great — and most underrated — comic talents of our era. But what comes across most powerfully in this definitive memoir is the depth of love Lewis felt, and still feels, for his partner, and which his partner felt for him: truly a love to last for all time.","[""Biography"",""Nonfiction"",""Memoir"",""Autobiography"",""Humor"",""Biography Memoir"",""Film"",""Music"",""History"",""Media Tie In""]",10/25/2005,2005.0,"{""name"":""Jerry Lewis"",""num_books"":43,""num_followers"":""29""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":66,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":146,""reviews_percentage"":3},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":721,""reviews_percentage"":19},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1360,""reviews_percentage"":36},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1445,""reviews_percentage"":38}}","""$8.99""",external,external_focus,True

They motivate us, provide us with our individual uniqueness, and ultimately change the structure and function of our brains.

In Born to Believe , Andrew Newberg, MD, and Mark Waldman reveal -- for the very first time -- how our complex views, memories, superstitions, morals, and beliefs are created by the neural activities of the brain. Supported by groundbreaking original research, they explain how our brains construct our deepest convictions and fondest assumptions about reality and the world around us. Using science, psychology, and religion, the authors offer recommendations for exercising your brain in order to develop a more life-affirming, flexible range of attitudes.

Each Quimpo sibling bears witness to the events they and others did so much to shape. From aborted attempts to smuggle weapons for the NPA to heady times organizing 'spontaneous uprisings' and general strikes in Mindanao, from the cruel discovery of the cause of one brother's death at the hands of a 'kasama' (comrade) to the near hallucinatory tales of imprisonment and torture at the hands of the military, these stories remind us of the personal costs and the daily heroism of those who joined the movement. But they also bring forth its messy and unresolved legacies of sons alienated from their father; daughters abused and victimized by the military and deluded by a religious cult; brothers lost to the war; friends betrayed, comrades purged, and revolutionary affection soured and then destroyed by intractable ideological differences. Such stories are much less about an unfinished revolution as they are about an inconclusive one.

Over 400 years, beginning with Vesalius, they charted the main systems of the body, made precise studies of living organs, documented embryonic development, and described pathologies. Human Anatomy includes portfolios of the work of 19 great anatomical artists, with concise biographies, and culminates with the Visible Human Project, which uses digital tools to visualize the human body.

  The system particularly fails the first-generation, the low-income, and students of color who predominate in coming generations. What we need to know is changing more quickly than ever, and a rising tide of information threatens to swamp knowledge and wisdom.

All of them elaborate a positive ontology, despite the incompatibility of their results. Meanwhile, the new generation of continental thinkers is pushing these trends still further, as seen in currents ranging from transcendental materialism to the London-based speculative realism movement to new revivals of Derrida.

Contrary to the conventional wisdom in biology and economics, this generous and civic-minded behavior is widespread and cannot be explained simply by far-sighted self-interest or a desire to help close genealogical kin. In A Cooperative Species, Samuel Bowles and Herbert Gintis--pioneers in the new experimental and evolutionary science of human behavior--show that the central issue is not why selfish people act generously, but instead how genetic and cultural evolution has produced a species in which substantial numbers make sacrifices to uphold ethical norms and to help even total strangers. The authors describe how, for thousands of generations, cooperation with fellow group members has been essential to survival. Groups that created institutions to protect the civic-minded from exploitation by the selfish flourished and prevailed in conflicts with less cooperative groups. Key to this process was the evolution of social emotions such as shame and guilt, and our capacity to internalize social norms so that acting ethically became a personal goal rather than simply a prudent way to avoid punishment.

According to a stunning new theory, this singular event may also have completely altered the genetic evolution of humankind. It was an event that released 3,000 times the energy of Mt. St. Helens.

The new book, Supervolcano , explores this eruption of the Toba supervolcano in Sumatra, Indonesia, its far-reaching impact, and the strong possibility of another supervolcano eruption in our lifetime.

Supervolcanoes are considered one of the five biggest threats to humankind, along with asteroids, nuclear war, disease, and global warming. But of those, supervolcanoes are the only threat that cannot be prevented.

And their effects are catastrophic. So devastating was the Toba eruption and the sheer amount of ash it released into the atmosphere, it altered the global climate for years, creating a mini Ice Age that obliterated massive amounts of plant, animal, and human life. A new theory claims this earth-shattering event also caused a severe ""population bottleneck"" in humans, leading to the eventual extinction of all other branches of our species with the exception of one...the branch that survived Toba and became modern humans.

Mills""]",4.28,117,10.0,"Liberalism is the political philosophy of equal persons - yet liberalism has denied equality to those it saw as sub-persons. Liberalism is the creed of fairness - yet liberalism has been complicit with European imperialism and African slavery. Liberalism is the classic ideology of Enlightenment and political transparency - yet liberalism has cast a dark veil over its actual racist past and present. In sum, liberalism's promise of equal rights has historically been denied to blacks and other people of color. In Black Rights/White Wrongs: The Critique of Racial Liberalism, political philosopher Charles Mills challenges mainstream accounts that ignore this history and its current legacy in self-conceivedly liberal polities today. Mills argues that rather than bracket as an anomaly the role of racism in the development of liberal theory, we should see it as shaping that theory in fundamental ways. As feminists have urged us to see the dominant form of liberalism as a patriarchal liberalism, so too Mills suggests we should see it as a racialized liberalism. It is unsurprising, then, if contemporary liberalism has yet to deliver on the recognition of black rights and the correction of white wrongs. These essays look at racial liberalism, past and present: ""white ignorance"" as a guilty ignoring of social reality that facilitates white racial domination; Immanuel Kant's role as the most important liberal theorist of both personhood and sub-personhood; the centrality of racial exploitation in the United States; and the evasion of white supremacy in John Rawls's ""ideal theory"" framing of social justice and in the work of most other contemporary white political philosophers. Nonetheless, Mills still believes that a deracialized liberalism is both possible and desirable. He concludes by calling on progressives to ""Occupy liberalism!"" and develop accordingly a radical liberalism aimed at achieving racial justice.","[""Philosophy"",""Politics"",""Race"",""History"",""Nonfiction"",""Theory"",""Sociology"",""Social Justice"",""School"",""Anti Racist""]",3/29/2017,2017.0,"{""name"":""Charles W.

Doughty""]",4.09,88,12.0,"As the driving force behind the Allied effort in World War I, France willingly shouldered the heaviest burden. In this masterful book, Robert Doughty explains how and why France assumed this role and offers new insights into French strategy and operational methods. French leaders, favoring a multi-front strategy, believed the Allies could maintain pressure on several fronts around the periphery of the German, Austrian, and Ottoman empires and eventually break the enemy's defenses. But France did not have sufficient resources to push the Germans back from the Western Front and attack elsewhere. The offensives they launched proved costly, and their tactical and operational methods ranged from remarkably effective to disastrously ineffective. Using extensive archival research, Doughty explains why France pursued a multi-front strategy and why it launched numerous operations as part of that strategy. He also casts new light on France's efforts to develop successful weapons and methods and the attempts to use them in operations. An unparalleled work in French or English literature on the war, Pyrrhic Victory is destined to become the standard account of the French army in the Great War.","[""History"",""Military History"",""World War I"",""France"",""Nonfiction"",""War"",""Military Fiction""]",11/15/2005,2005.0,"{""name"":""Robert A.

You're not just imagining it: People are getting more and more rude—from cutting in line, gabbing on their phones and clipping their nails on public transportation, to hurling epithets on Twitter and in real life (including a certain President who does both). And the worst part is that it's contagious, leading reasonably courteous people to stoop to new lows in order to respond to the ever-coarsening encounters we face every day.

In this engaging and illuminating new book, bestselling author and all-around curious guy Danny Wallace looks at the reasons behind the rudeness, and what we can do to stop it. His quest to stop the madness includes interviews with neuroscientists, psychologists, NASA scientists, politicians, and other experts. He joins a Radical Honesty group, talks to LA drivers about road rage, and confronts his own online troll in a pub—all to better understand the scourge that's turning normal people into bullies, tantruming toddlers, trolls, and other types of everyday monsters.

Drawing on around 15 hours of new interviews with Keating, coupled with access to his extensive personal files, this book tells the story of a political warrior’s rise to power, from the outer suburbs of Sydney through Young Labor and into parliament at just 25 years of age; serving as a minister in the last days of the Whitlam government; his path-breaking term as treasurer in the 1980s; his four-year prime ministership from 1991 to 1996; and his passions and interests since. Bramston has interviewed more than 100 people who know and worked with Keating, including his family, parliamentary colleagues, advisers, party officials, union leaders, public servants, and journalists. This book includes interviews with Gough Whitlam, Malcolm Fraser, Bob Hawke, John Howard, Kevin Rudd, Julia Gillard, Tony Abbott, Doug Anthony, Bill Hayden, Andrew Peacock, Ian Sinclair, John Hewson, Alexander Downer, Peter Costello, Kim Beazley, Simon Crean, Cheryl Kernot, and Bob Carr. Bramston has secured access to Labor archives, and he also documents key debates in once-secret cabinet papers, reveals caucus minutes for the first time, draws on the unpublished diaries of Neal Blewett and Bob Carr, discloses meeting records from the archives of US presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, talks to former British prime minister Tony Blair, and shares his new discoveries from the personal files of Gough Whitlam, Bill Hayden, Bob Hawke, and John Howard. Paul Keating saw political leadership as the combination of courage and imagination, a belief that powered his public career and helps explain his extraordinary triumphs and crushing lows. Keating blazed a trail of reform with a vision for Australia’s future that still attracts ardent admirers and the staunchest critics. This book chronicles, analyses, and interprets Keating’s life, and draws lessons for a Labor Party and a country still reluctant to fully embrace his legacy.

I knew it wasn't an accident, even though the medics and police never suspected suicide. Stuart had been talking about ending his life for a year. His most recent suicide attempt had been only three weeks earlier. Afterwards, he explained that day as the most peaceful day of his life. Sitting next to the dam, he smoked his last cigarette. He drank a hundred sleeping pills and did a final check to make sure everything would look like an accident. The last thing he remembered was swimming out into the crystal clear water. He said that he was no longer scared of dying, that there was nothing scary about it. Living was the scary thing.

It Rains in February: A Wife's Memoir of Love and Loss is the true story of a husband's depression and obsession, not only with another woman but also with ending his life. In this honest and heartfelt narrative, Leila Summers weaves a compelling tale of the year that led up to Stuart's suicide and the grief, profound loss and self-discovery that followed.

Rather, it is concerned with why this interpretation plays such an important role in demonstrating the contemporary relevance of psychoanalytic concepts. In order for Freud to use the Oedipus complex as a means for the interpretation of texts, it was necessary first of all for a particular notion of Oedipus, belonging to the Romantic reinvention of Greek antiquity, to have produced a certain idea of the power of that thought which does not think, and the power of that speech which remains silent. From this it does not follow that the Freudian unconscious was already prefigured by the aesthetic unconscious.

Weaving together the cosmos' history and our own in an expanding intellectual adventure story, Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs takes us from the mysteries of dark matter and our cosmic environment to the conditions for life on Earth.

Sixty-six million years ago, an object the size of a city descended from space to crash into Earth, creating a cataclysm that killed off the dinosaurs, along with three-quarters of the other species on the planet. What was its origin? Randall proposes it was a comet that was dislodged from its orbit as the Solar System passed through a disk of dark matter that is embedded in the plane of the Milky Way. Her research challenges the usual assumptions about the simple nature of dark matter and demonstrates how scientists formulate and establish new ideas. In a sense, it might have been dark matter that killed the dinosaurs.

With her unique and wide-ranging perspective, Randall connects dark matter to the history of the world in the broadest terms. Bringing in pop culture and social and political viewpoints, she shares with us the latest findings—established and speculative—regarding dark matter, the cosmos, the galaxy, asteroids, comets, and impacts, as well as life's development and extinctions. Randall makes clear how connected the planet is to the makeup of the Universe, but also how fragile our place in the Universe, which evolved over billions of years, might be.

In this brilliant and fresh exploration of our cosmic environment, Professor Randall explains the underlying science of our world in the breathtaking tale of a Universe in which the small and the large, the visible and the hidden are intimately related. Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs illuminates the deep relationships that are critical to our world as well as the astonishing beauty of the structures and connections that surround us. It's impossible to read this book and look at either Earth or sky again in the same way.","[""Science"",""Nonfiction"",""Physics"",""Astronomy"",""History"",""Space"",""Audiobook"",""Popular Science"",""Nature"",""Dinosaurs""]",10/27/2015,2015.0,"{""name"":""Lisa Randall"",""num_books"":19,""num_followers"":""466""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":62,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":280,""reviews_percentage"":8},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1044,""reviews_percentage"":31},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1268,""reviews_percentage"":37},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":695,""reviews_percentage"":20}}","""$14.81""",external,external_focus,False

He also harbored a terrifying  his attraction to men. As Strub explored the capital’s political and social circles, he discovered a parallel world where powerful men lived double lives shrouded in shame. When the AIDS epidemic hit in the early 1980s, Strub was living in New York and soon found himself attending “more funerals than birthday parties.” Scared and angry, he turned to radical activism to combat discrimination and demand research. Strub takes you through his own diagnosis and inside ACT UP, the organization that transformed a stigmatized cause into one of the defining political movements of our time. From the New York of Studio 54 and Andy Warhol’s Factory to the intersection of politics and burgeoning LGBT and AIDS movements, Strub’s story crackles with history.

It is with these words that Advice on Dying takes flight. Using a seventeenth-century poem written by a prominent scholar-practitioner, His Holiness the Dalai Lama draws from a wide range of traditions and beliefs to explore the stages we all go through when we die, which are the very same stages we experience in life when we go to sleep, faint, or reach orgasm (Shakespeare's ""little death""). The stages are described so vividly that we can imagine the process of traveling deeper into the mind, on the ultimate journey of transformation. In this way, His Holiness shows us how to prepare for that time and, in doing so, how to enrich our time on earth, die without fear or upset, and influence the stage between this life and the next so that we may gain the best possible incarnation. As always, the ultimate goal is to advance along the path to enlightenment.

One sees the clash of  nomads against agricultural societies, infantry against cavalry, as well as the greatest technological change in history―the combination of the composite bow and the chariot.

This readable account analyzes ancient armies in terms of modern military doctrine, allowing the reader to make comparisons between the combatants. Recruitment, for example, varied tremendously with Romans drawing from a limited pool of recruits for service terms of twenty to thirty years and Chinese planners preferring a large pool with short-term service. While various types of governments prepared for and waged war in significantly different ways, Bradford finds that better organization led to success on the battlefield and that, for the most part, societal innovation was more important than technological innovation.

Within the pages of The Trail of Ted Bundy: Digging Up the Untold Stories, you’ll hear the voices - many for the first time - of some of Ted Bundy’s friends, as they bring to light the secrets of what is was like to know him while he was actively involved in murder. The stories of his victims are here as well, as told by their friends, including the information and anecdotes that didn’t make it into the investigative files.

Two of the former detectives who worked with author Kevin Sullivan during the writing of his widely-acclaimed book, The Bundy Murders, return to aid readers in fully understanding Bundy’s murderous career; it’s ripple-effect impact on those who came into contact with him in one way or another, and dispelling commonly held myths.

The Trail of Ted Bundy is a journey back in time, to when Ted Bundy was killing young woman and girls in the Pacific Northwest and beyond. It’s told by those who knew him, and you’ll hear their revealing stories, many being voiced for the very first time. The friends of the victims are here as well, and they too share their insights about the victims, and some of what they tell here had been held back from the investigators, such was their commitment to their deceased friends. It’s also the story of those who hunted Bundy; those who guarded him, and those who otherwise were a part of this strange case one way or another.

Standing in front of the structure, there is no obvious reminder that evil once invaded this dwelling in the middle of the night. Just off to the right of the front door, on the side of the house, is the door leading to the basement. It was through this door that Bundy would carry Lynda out into the chilly night air.

As I walked up the steps my mind was riveted on that night. I thought of Bundy, and how he also had walked up these steps before slowly turning the doorknob that cold evening to see if it was unlocked. Having already written The Bundy Murders, I was well aware of what transpired there and, at such a moment, it all becomes so very real. Indeed, in my view, the Lynda Healy abduction is the strangest of his career, and I don’t ever expect to hear of one more bizarre, either from the past or in the future.”","[""True Crime"",""Nonfiction"",""Crime"",""History""]",1/1/2016,2016.0,"{""name"":""Kevin M.

Forsaking blindingly technical statistics and doomsday scenarios, Dr. Spencer explains in simple terms how the climate system really works, why man's role in global warming is more myth than science, and how the global warming hype has corrupted Washington and the scientific community. The reasons, Spencer explains, are numerous: biases in governmental funding of scientific research, our misconceptions about science and basic economics, even our religious beliefs and worldviews. From Al Gore to Leonardo DiCaprio, the climate change industry has given a platform to leading figures from all walks of life, as pandering politicians, demagogues and biased scientists forge a self-interested movement whose proposed policy initiatives could ultimately devastate the economies of those developing countries they purport to aid. Climate Confusion is a much needed wake up call for all of us on planet earth. Dr. Spencer's clear-eyed approach, combined with his sharp wit and intellect, brings transparency and levity to the issue of global warming as he takes on wrong-headed attitudes and misguided beliefs that have led to our state of panic. Climate Confusion lifts the shroud of mystery that has hovered here for far too long and offers an end to this frenzy of misinformation in our lives. --This text refers to the Hardcover edition.","[""Science"",""Politics"",""Nonfiction"",""Climate Change"",""Political Science"",""Global Warming"",""Environment"",""Economics""]",3/7/2008,2008.0,"{""name"":""Roy W.

It doesn’t take much--just hearing of someone else’s accomplishments, being criticized, getting into an argument, making a mistake at work--to make us feel that we are not okay. Beginning to understand how our lives have become ensnared in this trance of unworthiness is our first step toward reconnecting with who we really are and what it means to live fully. --from Radical AcceptanceRadical Acceptance“Believing that something is wrong with us is a deep and tenacious suffering,” says Tara Brach at the start of this illuminating book. This suffering emerges in crippling self-judgments and conflicts in our relationships, in addictions and perfectionism, in loneliness and overwork--all the forces that keep our lives constricted and unfulfilled. Radical Acceptance offers a path to freedom, including the day-to-day practical guidance developed over Dr. Brach’s twenty years of work with therapy clients and Buddhist students.Writing with great warmth and clarity, Tara Brach brings her teachings alive through personal stories and case histories, fresh interpretations of Buddhist tales, and guided meditations. Step by step, she leads us to trust our innate goodness, showing how we can develop the balance of clear-sightedness and compassion that is the essence of Radical Acceptance. Radical Acceptance does not mean self-indulgence or passivity. Instead it empowers genuine change: healing fear and shame and helping to build loving, authentic relationships. When we stop being at war with ourselves, we are free to live fully every precious moment of our lives.From the Hardcover edition.","[""Self Help"",""Nonfiction"",""Spirituality"",""Psychology"",""Buddhism"",""Philosophy"",""Personal Development"",""Audiobook"",""Mental Health"",""Religion""]",10/1/2000,2000.0,"{""name"":""Tara Brach"",""num_books"":34,""num_followers"":""1792""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":457,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1177,""reviews_percentage"":4},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":4674,""reviews_percentage"":15},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":9784,""reviews_percentage"":33},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":13158,""reviews_percentage"":44}}","""$9.99""",internal,internal_focus,False

Why do companies market themselves as pink ribbon leaders in the fight against breast cancer, yet use hormone-disrupting and carcinogenic chemicals that may contribute to that very disease?

Why do products used by men and women of childbearing age contain chemicals linked to birth defects and infertility?

Their daily experiences at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue taught them valuable lessons about how to work productively with people from different walks of life and points of view. These Washington insiders share what they’ve learned through first person examples of their own glamorous (and sometimes harrowing) moments with celebrities, foreign leaders and that most unpredictable of animals—the American politician.This book is for you if you feel unsure of yourself in social settings, if you’d like to get along more easily with others, or if you want to break through to a new level of cooperation with your boss and coworkers. They give specific advice for how to exude confidence even when you don’t feel it, ways to establish your reputation as an individual whom people like, trust, and want to help, and lay out the specific social skills still essential to success - despite our increasingly digitized world. Jeremy and Lea prove that social skills are learned behavior that anyone can acquire, and tell the stories of their own unlikely paths to becoming the social arbiters of the White House, while providing tantalizing insights into the character of the first ladies and presidents they served.This is not a book about old school etiquette; they explain the things we all want to know, like how to walk into a roomful of strangers and make friends, what to do about a difficult colleague who makes you dread coming to work each day, and how to navigate the sometimes-treacherous waters of social media in a special chapter on “Virtual Manners.” For lovers of White House history, this is a treasure of never-before-published anecdotes from the authors and their fellow former social secretaries as they describe pearl-clutching moments with presidents and first ladies dating back to the Johnson administration.The authors make a case for the importance of a return to treating people well in American political life, maintaining that democracy cannot be sustained without public civility.Foreword by Laura Bush","[""Nonfiction"",""Self Help"",""Business"",""Politics"",""Memoir"",""Audiobook"",""Personal Development"",""Psychology"",""Relationships"",""Biography""]",1/9/2018,2018.0,"{""name"":""Lea Berman"",""num_books"":1,""num_followers"":""11""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":17,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":95,""reviews_percentage"":8},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":337,""reviews_percentage"":29},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":439,""reviews_percentage"":38},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":247,""reviews_percentage"":21}}","""$13.99""",internal,external_focus,False

Is it possible that the riddle of America’s military failure in Vietnam has a one-word, one-man answer?

Unless and until we understand General William Westmoreland, we will never understand what went wrong in Vietnam. An Eagle Scout at fifteen, First Captain of his West Point class, Westmoreland fought in two wars and became Superintendent at West Point. Then he was chosen to lead the war effort in Vietnam for four crucial years. He proved a disaster. He could not think creatively about unconventional warfare, chose an unavailing strategy, stuck to it in the face of all opposition, and stood accused of fudging the results when it mattered most. In this definitive portrait, Lewis Sorley makes a plausible case that the war could have been won were it not for Westmoreland. The tragedy of William Westmoreland carries lessons not just for Vietnam, but for the future of American leadership.

Not enough to keep America competitive, and not enough to provide our citizens with fulfilling lives.

When A Nation at Risk called attention to the problems of our public schools in 1983, that landmark report provided a convenient ""cover"" for higher education, inadvertently implying that all was well on America's campuses.

Declining by Degrees blows higher education's cover. It asks tough--and long overdue--questions about our colleges and universities. In candid, coherent, and ultimately provocative ways, Declining by Degrees 
- how students are being short-changed by lowered academic expectations and standards;
-why many universities focus on research instead of teaching and spend more on recruiting and athletics than on salaries for professors;
-why students are disillusioned;
-how administrations are obsessed with rankings in news magazines rather than the quality of learning;
-why the media ignore the often catastrophic results; and
-how many professors and students have an unspoken ""non-aggression pact"" when it comes to academic effort.

Declining by Degrees argues persuasively that the multi-billion dollar enterprise of higher education has gone astray. At the same time, these essays offer specific prescriptions for change, warning that our nation is in fact at greater risk if we do nothing.","[""Education"",""Nonfiction""]",6/1/2005,2005.0,"{""name"":""Richard H.

https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11502462,11502462,بیشعوری، راهنمای تشخیص و درمان خطرناکترین بیماری تاریخ بشریت,"[""Xavier Crement""]",2.76,4795,550.0,"خاویر کرمنت نویسنده کتاب بیشعوری 26 سال پیش نسبت به شخصیت دونالد ترامپ هشدار می‌دهد و به طور آشکار او را بیشعور می‌خواند. در جایی از کتاب بیشعوری به کتاب مقدس بیشعورهای تاجر به نام «هنر دزدی» اثر «دونالد کرامپ» اشاره می‌شود. که مقصود نویسنده کتاب «هنر معامله» نوشته «دونالد ترامپ»، رئیس جمهور فعلی آمریکا، است.
در کتاب می شنویم:
«کتاب مقدس این نوع بیشعورها (بیشعورهای تاجر) کتابی است به نام هنر دزدی از دونالد کرامپ که می‌نویسد:«راستی و درستی، مهمل و بی‌معنی اند. همیشه مفیدترین راهکارها در تجارت، مدیریت درستکاری عداد و ارقام است. چرا باید برای به‌دست آوردن چیزی به سختی و با صداقت کار کرد وقتی می‌توان آن را به راحتی دزدید؟»
چاره‌ای هم نیست وقتی یک نفر با کمبود لیاقت و توانایی اصرار داشته باشد که در جلسات، مذاکرات و محاسبات به هر نحوی کارش را پیش ببرد، باید کمبودهایش را با حقه بازی، حرافی و بلوف زدن جبران کند. بیشعورهای گنده‌گو از همینجا پیدا می‌شوند. او هنرنمایی یک گنده‌گو وقتی است که سرنخ کلام از دستش رفته باشد و نداند درباره چی حرف می‌زند. چنین بیشعوری خودش را در برانگیختن دیگران (چرندگویی)، خلاقیت(دزدیدن ایده‌های دیگران)، تعامل (ارعاب دیگران) و مدیریت (سرپوش گذاشتن بر گندکاری‌هایش) خبره نشان می‌دهد.
کتاب صوتی بیشعوری اثر خاویر کرمنت است. نویسنده ای که بیست سال آزگار با بیشعوری خود، خانواده و اطرافیانش را آزار داد. از دید او تقریبا همه افراد بیشعورند. اگر معتقدید که بهتر است کرمنت درمورد زندگی خودش نظر بدهد باید بگویم بی شعوری یک بیماری است که اغلب افراد مبتلا، از آن بی اطلاع هستند و معمولا در قبال این اتهام می گویند: من بي‌شعور نيستم، تو بیشعوري. بعضي خصوصيات مشترك بیشعورها از اين قرار است: خودپسندي فجيع، نفرت انگيزي بي حد، خيرخواهي متكبرانه، ضميرناخودآگاه غيرقابل نفوذ، كسب قدرت با خوار و ضعيف كردن ديگران، امتنا از صفات اصلي انساني و سوءاستفاده بي رحمانه از آدم های ساده. اگر هنوز هم فکر می کنید که تنها همسایه بی ملاحظه یا مدیر بی احساستان گرفتار بیشعوری هستند پیشنهاد می کنم این کتاب را گوش کنید تا با مثال های ملموس خاویر کرمنت مصداق های بارز بیشعوری را در خود و اطرافتان ببینید.

این کتاب در سال 1990 در امریکا منتشر شد و محمود فرجامی آن را اولین بار در سال 1390 به زبان فارسی ترجمه نمود. هرچند به دلیل نگرفتن مجوز چاپ آن را به صورت اینترنتی منتشر کرد تا بالاخره در سال 1394 به صورت چاپی در ویترین کتاب فروشی ها قرار گرفت. این کتاب در ایران از همان ابتدا با استقبال فراوانی مواجه شد که البته نثر روان و طنزآلود فرجامی در این محبوبیت بی تأثیر نبوده است.

بیشعوری نوعی اعتیاد است مثل اعتیاد به مواد مخدر یا الکل. فرد معتاد تمایل به تکرار کار خود دارد و این اعتیاد از فرد به جامعه سرایت می کند و محیطی آزاردهنده را به وجود می آورد. بیشعورها چندین دسته اند و ویژگی های مشخصی دارند. آن ها قانون های نانوشته ای دارند، مثلا: تمام قوانين براي اين به وجود آمده‌اند كه نقض شوند، اما فقط تو، حق داري كه آن را زيرپا بگذاري نه ديگران و یا تمام مشكلات را ديگران به وجود آورده‌اند. آن ها بر این باورند که علت اعتراض مهم نيست. مهم خود اعتراض كردن است كه به خاطر آن زندگي مي کنند و همواره معترضند.

کمترین بهره ای که پس از شنیدن کتاب می برید، این است که می توانید بیشعورها را بشناسید و از آن ها دوری کنید اما، شاید آنچه که در این کتاب صوتی شنونده را بیش از یک کتاب طنز و یا بیانگر واقعیت های تلخ اجتماعی با خود همراه می کند نشان دادن روش برخورد با بیشعورها و چگونگی درمان بیشعوری است. خاویر کرمنت انواع و اقسام مثال ها از انسان های بیشعور را با ذکر جزئی ترین رفتارها بیان می کند و چون این فضا قصه های واقعی از زندگی خود و نزدیکانش را به همراه دارد شیرینی دوچندانی به کتاب می بخشد.

هرکسی گفته هیچ بیشعوری در دنیا وجود ندارد، خودش هم بیشعور است. من سه تا بچه بیشعور دارم و هر روز دارم هر چهارتاشان را تحمل می کنم. آخر شوهرم هم بیشعور است.

O’Driscoll paints an intimate portrait of Hyrum Smith, an exemplary disciple who stood by his prophet-brother through the glorious and trying days of the early restored Church. At Joseph’s side during dark months of confinement in Liberty Jail, Nauvoo’s rise to fame, and the martyrdom at Carthage, Hyrum was “as firm as the pillars of heaven.” Hyrum  A Life of Integrity reveals the heart of this Church patriarch and assistant president through the words of those who knew him best and through the inspiring, unassuming sermon that was his life. Relying on painstaking research, the author helps us appreciate the character and invaluable contributions of this devoted husband, father, Church leader, and friend. Most important, we learn why the Lord said of Hyrum, “I, the Lord, love him because of the integrity of his heart.”

In 1572, Roman Catholic soldiers slaughtered thousands of French Huguenots for their Protestant faith.

This calamity forced many Protestants to ask whether taking up arms against a king was even lawful.

Many Christians thought that even in the case of persecution, kings had absolute power and lesser magistrates had no right to resist them. 

Vindiciae contra Tyrannos: A Defense of Liberty against Tyrants, written by an anonymous Huguenot, is a powerful tract that makes a case for why Christians can sometimes lawfully resist and fight against tyrants and persecutors of the faith.

The apostles told the Jews that they needed to obey God rather than man when it came to the Gospel, and to this day many Christians need to be reminded that men only derive their power from God and there are indeed times when resisting the authorities may be lawful and even biblically required.

This tract is thoroughly biblical and a great testament to the courage and convictions of our fathers in the faith.

""Kings must be obeyed for God’s cause, and not against God, and then, when they serve and obey God, and not otherwise. . . That sentence of God Almighty must always remain irrevocably true: ‘I will not give My glory to any other,’ (Is. 42:8), that is, no man shall have such absolute authority."" ~From the Vindiciae","[""Theology"",""Politics"",""History"",""Classics"",""Christian"",""Nonfiction"",""Philosophy"",""Government"",""Church History"",""Cultural""]",1/1/1579,,"{""name"":""Stephen Junius Brutus"",""num_books"":2,""num_followers"":""2""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":0,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":0,""reviews_percentage"":0},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":16,""reviews_percentage"":14},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":51,""reviews_percentage"":45},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":46,""reviews_percentage"":40}}","""$7.95""",external,external_focus,True

Goldsmith""]",3.86,543,45.0,"Is the Internet erasing national borders? Will the future of the Net be set by Internet engineers, rogue programmers, the United Nations, or powerful countries? Who's really in control of what's happening on the Net?

In this provocative new book, Jack Goldsmith and Tim Wu tell the fascinating story of the Internet's challenge to governmental rule in the 1990s, and the ensuing battles with governments around the world. It's a book about the fate of one idea--that the Internet might liberate us forever from government, borders, and even our physical selves. We learn of Google's struggles with the French government and Yahoo's capitulation to the Chinese regime; of how the European Union sets privacy standards on the Net for the entire world; and of eBay's struggles with fraud and how it slowly learned to trust the FBI. In a decade of events the original vision is uprooted, as governments time and time again assert their power to direct the future of the Internet. The destiny of the Internet over the next decades, argue Goldsmith and Wu, will reflect the interests of powerful nations and the conflicts within and between them.

While acknowledging the many attractions of the earliest visions of the Internet, the authors describe the new order, and speaking to both its surprising virtues and unavoidable vices. Far from destroying the Internet, the experience of the last decade has lead to a quiet rediscovery of some of the oldest functions and justifications for territorial government. While territorial governments have unavoidable problems, it has proven hard to replace what legitimacy governments have, and harder yet to replace the system of rule of law that controls the unchecked evils of anarchy. While the Net will change some of the ways that territorial states govern, it will not diminish the oldest and most fundamental roles of government and challenges of governance.

Well written and filled with fascinating examples, including colorful portraits of many key players in Internet history, this is a work that is bound to stir heated debate in the cyberspace community.","[""Nonfiction"",""Technology"",""Internet"",""History"",""Politics"",""Law"",""Science"",""Academic"",""Sociology"",""Computers""]",2/24/2006,2006.0,"{""name"":""Jack L.

And as we discover countless exoplanets orbiting other stars—among them, rocky super-Earths and gaseous Hot Jupiters—we become ever more hopeful that we may come across extraterrestrial life. Yet even as we become aware of the vast numbers of planets outside our solar system, it has also become clear that Earth is exceptional. The question  why?

In Lucky Planet , astrobiologist David Waltham argues that Earth’s climate stability is one of the primary factors that makes it able to support life, and that nothing short of luck made such conditions possible. The four-billion-year stretch of good weather that our planet has experienced is statistically so unlikely, he shows, that chances are slim that we will ever encounter intelligent extraterrestrial others.

Describing the three factors that typically control a planet’s average temperature—the heat received from its star, how much heat the planet absorbs, and the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere—Waltham paints a complex picture of how special Earth’s climate really is. He untangles the mystery of why, although these factors have shifted by such massive measures over the history of life on Earth, surface temperatures have never fluctuated so much as to make conditions hostile to life. Citing factors such as the size of our Moon and the effect of an ever-warming Sun, Waltham challenges the prevailing scientific consensus that other Earth-like planets have natural stabilizing mechanisms that allow life to flourish.

A lively exploration of the stars above and the ground beneath our feet, Lucky Planet seamlessly weaves the story of Earth and the worlds orbiting other stars to give us a new perspective of the surprising role chance plays in our place in the universe.","[""Science"",""Nonfiction"",""Environment"",""Astronomy"",""Physics"",""Biology"",""Nature"",""Geology"",""Geography"",""Planetary Science""]",4/8/2014,2014.0,"{""name"":""David Waltham"",""num_books"":3,""num_followers"":""2""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":9,""reviews_percentage"":5},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":51,""reviews_percentage"":31},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":65,""reviews_percentage"":39},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":38,""reviews_percentage"":23}}","""$15.99""",external,external_focus,True

Not according to Mark Samuel, who has helped thousands of people around the world get on the path to personal achievement and fulfillment. He shows why the key to becoming indispensable is to embrace accountability rather than run from it, in everything you do at work and in your personal life.You'll see how Samuel's Personal Accountability Model really worked for people such as:

- Lynn, who transformed herself from the worst teacher at her school to one of the most respected.

- Dan, an office assistant of ten years who finally figured out how to jumpstart his career.

- Mary, a super visor who had continually been skipped over for promotion, until she finally decided to stop ""playing it small.""

Only when he stopped blaming others could he find the energy and ideas to help his plant overcome its challenges.Becoming indispensable doesn't require a fancy degree, a senior management title, or a huge income.

For example, Venus teaches us that our affinities and quirks are clues to our unique mission and contribution to the world. The astrological language of the psyche is a tool for deciphering and revitalizing this sense of mission. Casey teaches you how to expand your range of intimacy with the ten parts of yourself represented by the planets, here called gods. You will learn how to use this language to reverence and feed the forces of your psyche that connect you to very real external forces. This book intends to catalyze a movement to engage the imagination of all people with a sense of humor and a desire to do collaborative good in the world.Expanding on the ideas first presented in her popular audiotape series, Inner and Outer Space, Casey explores the archetypes at the heart of human relationships, aspirations, and spiritual quests. In an engaging narrative enlivened by stories, fables, exercises, and meditations developed through her work as an astrological counselor, she provides a practical system of personal and collective liberation. Making the Gods Work for You provides us with innovative principles to live by and rituals inviting us to become active, dynamic participants in the dance of life.

Here, he shows how to develop reliable, in-depth interpretations for any birth chart, utilizing a precise, modern language.

STEPHEN ARROYO's eight books have made him one of the best-selling authors of modern astrology books worldwide. Among his works are Astrology, Psychology & the Four Elements; Astrology, Karma & Transformation; Relationships and Life Cycles; Stephen Arroyo's Chart Interpretation Handbook, & Exploring Jupiter. His writings have elicited such tremendously enthusiastic response internationally that they have now been translated into 20 languages, and he has been awarded the British Astrological Association Astrology Prize, the Fraternity of Canadian Astrologers' International Sun Award, and United Astrology Congress's Regulus Award.

Arroyo's work spans the spectrum of modern, psychologically oriented astrology, supported by his many years of one-to-one counseling work (he holds a California Marriage, Family & Child Counseling license), and body- and energy-centered therapies such as Polarity Therapy. With a background in mathematics and the arts (an honors degree in literature from University of California), and a master's degree in psychology, Stephen Arroyo has developed a system in which the individual's experience is foremost, disregarding the fatalism and negativity of old-fashioned astrology. His writings are renowned for the reliable methods he has distilled for understanding astrological principles in relation to the human energy field, in a way that people of all cultures and backgrounds can easily relate to. As Library Journal stated, his work is particularly notable for his unique ability to express complex concepts in clear, simple language that the reader can identify with and apply in his or her own life.

He led a dissolute life in Soho after the war, gambling and womanizing with fierce energy. He painted his wives nude, his children nude, himself nude. He married twice, had an uncountable number of children, and kept working through it all, painting everyone from close friend and rival Francis Bacon to Kate Moss and Queen Elizabeth. He sometimes spent years on a single painting, which could require hundreds of hours of sittings. However various his subjects, his intent was always the  to find and reveal the character hidden within by means of his intense visual imagination.

Profiling the most notorious mischief makers from the 1600s to the present day, Pranksters explores how ""pranks"" are part of a long tradition of speaking truth to power and social critique.

Invoking such historical and contemporary figures as P.T. Barnum, Jonathan Swift, WITCH, The Yes Men, and Stephen Colbert, Kembrew McLeod shows how staged spectacles that balance the serious and humorous can spark important public conversations. In some instances, tricksters have incited social change (and unfortunate prank blowback) by manipulating various forms of media, from newspapers to YouTube. For example, in the 1960s, self-proclaimed ""professional hoaxer"" Alan Abel lampooned America's hypocritical sexual mores by using conservative rhetoric to fool the news media into covering a satirical organization that advocated clothing naked animals. In the 1990s, Sub Pop Records then-receptionist Megan Jasper satirized the commodification of alternative music culture by pranking the New York Times into reporting on her fake lexicon of ""grunge speak."" Throughout this book, McLeod shows how pranks interrupt the daily flow of approved information and news, using humor to underscore larger, pointed truths.

The author traces the pivotal events in Doriot's life, including his experience as a decorated brigadier general during World War II; as a maverick professor at Harvard Business School; and as the architect and founder of the first venture capital firm, American Research and Development. It artfully chronicles Doriot's business philosophy and his stewardship in startups, such as the important role he played in the formation of Digital Equipment Corporation and many other new companies that later grew to be influential and successful.

An award-winning Business Week journalist, Ante gives us a rare look at a man who overturned conventional wisdom by proving that there is big money to be made by investing in small and risky businesses.

We might be aware of some of our fears—perhaps we are afraid of public speaking, financial hardship, or losing a loved one. But in this book meditation master Chögyam Trungpa shows us that most of us suffer from a far more pervasive form of fear: the fear of ourselves. We feel ashamed and embarrassed to look at our feelings or acknowledge our styles of thinking and behaving; we don’t want to face the reality of our moment-to-moment experience. It is this fear that keeps us trapped in cycles of suffering, despair, and distress. Chögyam Trungpa offers us a vision of moving beyond fear to discover the innate bravery, trust, and delight in life that lies at the core of our being. Drawing on the Shambhala tradition and on Buddhist teachings, he explains how we can each become a spiritual warrior: a person who faces each moment of life with openness and fearlessness. “The ultimate definition of bravery is not being afraid of who you are,” writes Chögyam Trungpa. In language that is fresh, accessible, and startlingly direct, this book explains:    • how the practice of sitting meditation can help us to uncover our inherent confidence and bravery,    • how fear and embarrassment about ourselves keep us trapped in cycles of suffering,    • the wisdom of loving-kindness and nonaggression,    • how true invincibility depends on becoming more open and vulnerable.

With wisdom, humor, and scientific aplomb, medical students and sex educators Nina Brochmann and Ellen Støkken Dahl take readers on a fascinating journey of female sexual organs and sexual health--from the clitoris to contraception to cervical cancer.

More than a user's manual, this book is demystification, and tribute to the vagina that we have been waiting for. The Wonder Down Under is filled with astonishing, important, and little-known information--relayed with both medical expertise and genuine empathy. Did you know, for instance, that female and male sex organs are merely variations on the same basic structure? Or that there's no such thing as a virginity test--because a broken hymen is not a meaningful indicator of whether or not someone's had sex?

Brochmann and Dahl have written a tour-de-force about the biology, anatomy, and reality of the female body, stopping along the way to explain how misinformation and silence about the vagina have been harmful to women over time. The Wonder Down Under makes crucial contributions to the discussion: the book was an instant bestseller that sold out in its native Norway in just three days. Since then it has been acquired by publishers in more than two dozen countries around the world.

To this day, the Ghost Dance remains widely mischaracterized as a primitive and failed effort by Indian militants to resist American conquest and return to traditional ways. In fact, followers of the Ghost Dance sought to thrive in modern America by working for wages, farming the land, and educating their children, tenets that helped the religion endure for decades after Wounded Knee.

He takes us to Saudi Arabia, where officials deflect inquiries about the amount of petroleum remaining in the country's largest reservoir; to Equatorial Guinea, where two tennis courts grace an oil-rich dictator's estate but bandages and aspirin are a hospital's only supplies; and to Venezuela, where Hugo Chávez's campaign to redistribute oil wealth creates new economic and political crises.Maass, a New York Times Magazine writer, also introduces us to Iraqi oilmen trying to rebuild their industry after the invasion of 2003, an American lawyer leading Ecuadorians in an unprecedented lawsuit against Chevron, a Russian oil billionaire imprisoned for his defiance of Vladimir Putin's leadership, and Nigerian villagers whose livelihoods are destroyed by the discovery of oil. Rebels, royalty, middlemen, environmentalists, indigenous activists, CEOs—their stories, deftly and sensitively presented, tell the larger story of oil in our time.Crude World is a startling and essential account of the consequences of our addiction to oil.","[""Nonfiction"",""Economics"",""Politics"",""Society"",""History"",""Environment"",""Science"",""Social Issues"",""Journalism"",""Sustainability""]",1/1/2009,2009.0,"{""name"":""Peter Maass"",""num_books"":18,""num_followers"":""17""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":7,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":33,""reviews_percentage"":6},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":142,""reviews_percentage"":28},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":227,""reviews_percentage"":44},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":96,""reviews_percentage"":19}}","""$14.99""",external,external_focus,True

As the file against Dreyfus shows—recently revealed by the French army and excerpted here for the first time in English—the case against Dreyfus was shockingly more complex, involving an affair between two military attachés, a series of forgeries, and an insidious campaign that subtly blended homophobia and anti-Semitism to thwart justice and land an innocent man in jail. Digging into the secret file, Tablet Magazine senior writer Liel Leibovitz offers a vivid new version of this seminal historical narrative, recasting the affair as a detective story set against the backdrop of beautifully decadent Belle Époque Paris. And helping to solve the crime here is an unexpected sleuth: Marcel Proust, a dedicated chronicler of the affair who, despite having never seen the secret allegations against Dreyfus, intuited them and incorporated them into his masterpiece of a novel. ’Conspiracy of Letters’ is a short and evocative story of history, literature, prejudice, and the way they often shape and inform each other.","[""Nonfiction"",""History""]",7/9/2013,2013.0,"{""name"":""Liel Leibovitz"",""num_books"":15,""num_followers"":""27""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":2,""reviews_percentage"":2},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":13,""reviews_percentage"":18},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":22,""reviews_percentage"":30},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":28,""reviews_percentage"":38},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":7,""reviews_percentage"":9}}","""$1.99""",external,external_focus,True

Both Christianity and the workers' socialism preach forthcoming salvation from bondage and misery; Christianity places this salvation in a life beyond, after death, in heaven; socialism places it in this world, in a transformation of society. Both are persecuted and baited, their adherents are despised and made the objects of exclusive laws, the former as enemies of the human race, the latter as enemies of the state, enemies of religion, the family, social order. And in spite of all persecution, nay, even spurred on by it, they forge victoriously, irresistibly ahead.

His work experience was chequered, at best, but included stints as a contributor to socialist newspapers in New York and London. He was self-taught, and possessed the enthusiasm and wrong-headedness of the autodidact.

Like a despot, too, he countenanced corruption on a scale rarely equalled in Canada. His fall, no less than his rise to power, contains elements of pathos, farce, and pure, farfetched wonderfulness.Richard Gwyn interviewed Smallwood extensively and enjoyed his subject’s full co-operation.

Kesler""]",3.62,69,8.0,"Is Barack Obama the savior of liberalism—or the last liberal president? Charles R. Kesler's spirited analysis of Obama's political thought shows that he represents either a new birth of liberalism—or its demise.

Who is Barack Obama? Though many of his own supporters wonder if he really believes in anything, Charles R. Kesler argues that these disappointed liberals don't appreciate the scope of the president's ambition or the long-term stakes for which he is playing.

Conservatives also misunderstand Obama, according to this leading conservative scholar, educator, and journalist. They dismiss him as a socialist, hopelessly out of touch with the American mainstream. The fringe Right dwells on Obama's foreign upbringing, his missing birth certificate, Bill Ayers's supposed authorship of his books. What mainstream and fringe have in common is a stubborn underestimation of the man and the political movement he embodies.

Reflecting a sophisticated mix of philosophy, psychology, and history, and complemented by a scathing wit, I Am the Change tries to understand Obama as he understands himself, based largely on his own writings, speeches, and interviews. Kesler, the rare conservative who takes Obama seriously as a political thinker, views him as a gifted and highly intelligent progressive who is attempting to become the greatest president in the history of modern liberalism. Intent on reinvigorating the liberal faith, Obama nonetheless fails to understand its fatal contradictions—a shortsightedness that may prove to be liberalism's undoing.

Will Obama save liberalism and become its fourth great incarnation, following Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Lyndon B. Johnson? Or will he be derailed by his very successes? These are the questions at the heart of Kesler's thoughtful and illuminating book.","[""Politics"",""History"",""Biography"",""Nonfiction""]",9/11/2012,2012.0,"{""name"":""Charles R.

Of particular note is Geertz's discussion of what he famously describes as the process of ""agricultural involution"" in Java, where both the external economic demands of the Dutch rulers and the internal pressures due to population growth led to intensification rather than change. ","[""Anthropology"",""History"",""Nonfiction"",""Sociology"",""Environment"",""Ecology"",""Agriculture"",""Asia"",""Economics"",""20th Century""]",1/28/1963,1963.0,"{""name"":""Clifford Geertz"",""num_books"":75,""num_followers"":""218""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":2,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":9,""reviews_percentage"":6},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":28,""reviews_percentage"":20},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":45,""reviews_percentage"":32},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":54,""reviews_percentage"":39}}","""$39.95""",external,external_focus,True

Swafford mines sources never before used in English-language biographies to reanimate the revolutionary ferment of Enlightenment-era Bonn, where Beethoven grew up and imbibed the ideas that would shape all of his future work. Swafford then tracks his subject to Vienna, capital of European music, where Beethoven built his career in the face of critical incomprehension, crippling ill health, romantic rejection, and “fate’s hammer,” his ever-encroaching deafness.

Reformers launched unprecedented campaigns reform criminals and prostitutes, to educate the deaf and the blind, guarantee women's rights, and abolish slavery. Our modern systems of free public schools, prisons, and hospitals for the mentally ill are all legacies of this era. Moralists and Modernizers tells the fascinating story of America's first age of reform―combining incisive portraits of leading reformers and movements with perceptive analysis of religion, politics, and society. Arguing that the reform impulse grew out of the era's peculiar mix of fear and hope, Steven Mintz shows that reform arose not only from fears of social disorder, family fragmentation, and widening class divisions, but also from a millennialist sense of possibility rooted in new religious and philosophical ideas. He then examines three distinct responses to pre-Civil War America's pressing social problems. Moral reform sought to create a Christian moral order using moral suasion. Social reform combatted poverty, crime, and ignorance through new institutions offering non-authoritarian forms of social control. Radical reform sought to regenerate American society by eliminating fundamental sources of inequality such as slavery and racial and sexual discrimination. In an epilogue, Mintz fits antebellum reform into the larger context of America's liberal tradition. Mintz concludes that America's pre-Civil War reformers were at once moral critics and cultural modernizers. As exponents of a distinctly modern set of values, reformers attacked outmoded customs, smoothed the transition from a preindustrial to an industrial order, and devised modern bureaucratic systems of criminal justice, public education, and social welfare. The first comprehensive account antebellum reform to appear in twenty years, Moralists and Modernizers is a rich and rewarding work of synthesis and interpretation which draws upon the most recent historical research. ""This book charts a middle ground between those who regard reform as a form of class-based social control and those who stress reformers' benevolent intentions. It emphasizes the duality of antebellum reform, which blended impulses toward social and moral uplift with impulses to impose new codes of personal conduct, shape character, and construct new institutions of social control.""―from Moralists and Modernizers","[""History"",""American History"",""Nonfiction""]",8/1/1995,1995.0,"{""name"":""Steven Mintz"",""num_books"":45,""num_followers"":""7""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":3,""reviews_percentage"":5},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":10,""reviews_percentage"":17},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":20,""reviews_percentage"":34},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":21,""reviews_percentage"":36},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":4,""reviews_percentage"":6}}",,external,internal_focus,True

Essays by the Fourteenth Dalai Lama appear with Galen Rowell's dramatic images in a moving presentation of the splendors of Tibet's revered but threatened heritage.

When Chinese communist troops invaded Tibet in 1950, the author was fifteen years old and the spiritual and temporal ruler of a nation the size of western Europe. Tenzin Gyatso, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama of Tibet, appealed to the United Nations for help and then fled across the Himalaya in winter to a border town, where he anxiously awaited political aid that never came.

Like the mythical kingdom of Shangri-La, Tibet had sought isolation from the rest of the world. Diplomatic relations and foreign visitors had been shunned, and few people in the West knew what cultural and natural treasures lay threatened there. In the years that followed, the Dalai Lama struggled to maintain peace in Tibet and to protect his people's ways, but in 1959 he was forced to flee to India, where he remains today. There he has established a government in exile in Dharamsala that has endeavored to preserve Tibetan culture while preparing for a peaceful return to a free Tibet.

As the Chinese cautiously opened select Tibetan doors to visitors in the 1980s, a sickening realization stole over the rest of the  Tibet had been ravaged by the Chinese occupation. All but a dozen of Tibet's six thousand monasteries had been destroyed.

Much of the once-bountiful wildlife had disappeared. A sixth of the population had perished. The picture seemed so bleak that many wondered whether there was anything worth saving in this wounded land.

The Dalai Lama's heartening answer and Galen Rowell's magnificent photographs leave no doubt that the mystery and enchantment of Tibet, though seriously endangered, are still alive. To Tibetans the Dalai Lama is an incarnation of the Buddha of compassion. He has spent the last thirty years tirelessly advocating nonviolence and compassion to all living things as the answer to Tibet's plight. ""My religion is simple,"" he says, ""my religion is kindness.""

My Tibet movingly elaborates this  here the Dalai Lama offers his views on how world peace, happiness, and environmental responsibility are inextricably linked. He explains the meaning of pilgrimage for Tibetan Buddhists and gives an engaging account of his early life in Lhasa, the capital of Tibet. In addition, he reveals many sides to his nature―compassion, profound faith, common sense, generosity, a playful sense of humor―in personal reflections matched here to 108 photographs of the land he hasn't seen since 1959. Together the breathtaking photographs, which express Rowell's own commitment to the natural world, and the Dalai Lama's observations help preserve the enduring meaning of Tibet's culture, religion, and natural heritage.","[""Nonfiction"",""Photography"",""Travel"",""History"",""Religion"",""Inspirational"",""Asia"",""Buddhism""]",1/1/1990,1990.0,"{""name"":""Dalai Lama XIV"",""num_books"":1131,""num_followers"":""5797""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":0,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":0,""reviews_percentage"":0},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":10,""reviews_percentage"":11},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":27,""reviews_percentage"":30},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":51,""reviews_percentage"":57}}",,external,internal_focus,True

The Enneagram of Passions and Virtues elucidates human experience beyond the personality structure. In the tradition of the enneagram, the Virtues are said to be the affective atmosphere that replaces the compulsive and reactive emotional patterns-called the Passions-as one becomes freer of the ego.

Sandra Maitri shows how the shift in our consciousness, or soul, from being informed by the Passions to being informed by the Virtues, is one of the hallmarks of inner development. In this book, Maitri explores how our awareness of the Passions, in turn, leads to the manifestation of the Virtues. This shift supports rowth on the level of personality as well as on the level of what is beyond-Being, or True Nature.

Maitri is widely known as one of the most literate and indepth writers and teachers on the uses of the enneagram as a tool of inner development.

True democracy, she insists, requires sharing power, not regulation by it; freedom, not protection.


Refusing any facile identification with one political position or another, Brown applies her argument to a panoply of topics, from the basis of litigiousness in political life to the appearance on the academic Left of themes of revenge and a thwarted will to power.

The Navy boys’ race against time mirrored the very real frenzy in the city that played host to 3 million servicemen, then shipped them out from its magnificent port to an uncertain destiny. This was a time when soldiers and sailors on their final flings jammed the Times Square movie houses featuring lavish stage shows as well as the nightclubs like the Latin Quarter and the Copacabana; a time when bobby-soxers swooned at the Paramount over Frank Sinatra, a sexy, skinny substitute for the boys who had gone to war. Richard Goldstein’s Helluva Town is a kaleidoscopic and compelling social history that captures the youthful electricity of wartime and recounts the important role New York played in the national war effort. This is a book that will prove irresistible to anyone who loves New York and its relentlessly fascinating saga. Wartime Broadway lives again in these pages through the plays of Lillian Hellman, Robert Sherwood, Maxwell Anderson, and John Steinbeck championing the democratic cause; Irving Berlin’s This Is the Army and Moss Hart’s Winged Victory with their all-servicemen casts; Rodgers and Hammerstein’s Oklahoma! hailing American optimism; the Leonard Bernstein–Jerome Robbins production of On the Town; and the Stage Door Canteen. And these were the days when the Brooklyn Navy Yard turned out battleships and aircraft carriers, when troopships bound for Europe departed from the great Manhattan piers where glamorous ocean liners once docked, where the most beautiful liner of them all, the Normandie , caught fire and capsized during its conversion to a troopship.

This is the city that served as a magnet for European artists and intellectuals, whose creative presence contributed mightily to New York’s boisterous cosmopolitanism. Long before 9/11, New York felt vulnerable to a foreign foe. Helluva Town recalls how 400,000 New Yorkers served as air-raid wardens while antiaircraft guns ringed the city in anticipation of a German bombing raid. Finally, this is the story of New York’s emergence as the power and glory of the world stage in the wake of V-J Day, underlined when the newly created United Nations arose beside the East River, climaxing a storied chapter in the history of the world’s greatest city.","[""World War II"",""Nonfiction"",""History"",""American History"",""Military History""]",1/1/2010,2010.0,"{""name"":""Richard Goldstein"",""num_books"":46,""num_followers"":""2""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":2,""reviews_percentage"":2},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":10,""reviews_percentage"":13},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":24,""reviews_percentage"":32},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":28,""reviews_percentage"":37},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":10,""reviews_percentage"":13}}","""$15.99""",external,external_focus,True

Four out of five doctors recommend this book for its GENEROUS PORTIONS OF HILARITY and ghastly pictures from RETRO COOKBOOKS.

It's an affectionate look at the days when starch ruled, pepper was a dangerous spice, and Stuffed Meat with Meat Sauce was considered health food.

Bon appetit!

The Gallery of Regrettable Food is a simple introduction to poorly photographed foodstuffs and horrid recipes from the Golden Age of Salt and Starch. It's a wonder anyone in the 1940s, '50s, and '60s gained any weight. It isn't that the food was inedible; it was merely dull. Everything was geared toward a timid palate fearful of spice. It wasn't nonnutritious -- no, between the limp boiled vegetables, fat-choked meat cylinders, and pink whipped Jell-O desserts, you were bound to find a few calories that would drag you into the next day. It's just that the pictures are so hideously unappealing.

Author James Lileks has made it his life's work to unearth the worst recipes and food photography from that bygone era and assemble them with hilarious, acerbic commentary: ""This is not meat. This is something they scraped out of the air filter from the engines of the Exxon Valdez."" It all started when he went home to Fargo and found an ancient recipe book in his mom's cupboard: Specialties of the House, from the North Dakota State Wheat Commission. He never looked back. Now, they're not really recipe books. They're ads for food companies, with every recipe using the company's products, often in unexpected and horrifying ways. There's not a single appetizing dish in the entire collection.

The pictures in the book are ghastly -- the Italian dishes look like a surgeon had a sneezing fit during an operation, and the queasy casseroles look like something on which the janitor dumps sawdust. But you have to enjoy the spirit behind the books -- cheerful postwar perfect housewifery, and folks with the guts to undertake such culinary experiments as stuffing cabbage with hamburger, creating the perfect tongue mousse when you have the fellas over for a pregame nosh, or, best of all, baking peppers with a creamy marshmallow sauce. Alas, too many of these dishes bring back scary childhood memories.","[""Humor"",""Food"",""Nonfiction"",""Cooking"",""History"",""Cookbooks"",""Pop Culture"",""Food and Drink"",""Comedy"",""Picture Books""]",9/11/2001,2001.0,"{""name"":""James Lileks"",""num_books"":15,""num_followers"":""45""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":50,""reviews_percentage"":2},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":91,""reviews_percentage"":4},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":280,""reviews_percentage"":15},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":583,""reviews_percentage"":31},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":834,""reviews_percentage"":45}}",,external,external_focus,False

Lucifer: Princeps is a seminal study on the origins of the Lucifer mythos by Peter Grey. It is the first in a two volume work; the companion volume, Praxis, being an exposition of ritual actions, is due to be published in 2016.

The fall of Lucifer, and that of the rebel angels who descended upon the daughters of men, comprise the foundation myth of the Western occult tradition. Lucifer: Princeps is a study of origins, a portrait of the first ancestor of witchcraft and magic. In tracing the genealogy of our patron and prince, the principles that underlie the ritual forms that have come down to us, through the grimoires and folk practices, are elucidated. The study draws on the extensive literature of history, religion and archaeology, engaging with the vital discoveries and advances of recent scholarship, which render previous works on Lucifer, however well intentioned, out of date. A concomitant exegesis of the core texts conjures the terrain and koine of the Ancient Near East, the cradle cultures and language of his nascence. Of critical importance are the effaced cultures and cults that lie behind the Old Testament polemics, viz. those of Assyria, Ugarit and Canaan, as well as Sumeria, Egypt and Greece; they provide the context that give meaning to what would otherwise be an isolated brooding figure, one who makes no sense without being encountered in the landscape.

Intended to be the definitive text on Lucifer for the witch, magician and student of the grimoires, Princeps spans wingtip to wingtip from the original flood myth and legends of divine teachers to the Church Fathers, notably Augustine, Origen and Tertullian. The tales of the Garden of Eden, the Nephilim, of the fall of Helel ben Šahar and the Prince of Tyre, the nature of Azazel, and the creation of the Satan are drawn beneath the shadow of these wings into a narrative that binds Genesis and Revelation via the Enochian tradition. The story of the Serpent in the Garden and that of Lucifer are revealed to be a singular myth whose true significance had been lost and can now be restored. It illuminates the path to apotheosis, and the role of the goddess as the transforming initiatrix who bestows the crown.","[""Occult"",""Witchcraft"",""Magick"",""Nonfiction"",""Religion"",""History"",""Magic"",""Spirituality"",""Esoterica""]",6/15/2015,2015.0,"{""name"":""Peter Grey"",""num_books"":52,""num_followers"":""95""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":0,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":2,""reviews_percentage"":1},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":9,""reviews_percentage"":6},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":59,""reviews_percentage"":39},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":79,""reviews_percentage"":53}}","""$9.99""",external,external_focus,True

Around one million Armenians were killed, and the survivors were scattered across the world. Although it is now a century old, the issue of what most of the world calls the Armenian Genocide of 1915 is still a live and divisive issue that mobilizes Armenians across the world, shapes the identity and politics of modern Turkey, and has consumed the attention of U.S. politicians for years. In Great Catastrophe, the eminent scholar and reporter Thomas de Waal looks at the aftermath and politics of the Armenian Genocide and tells the story of recent efforts by courageous Armenians, Kurds, and Turks to come to terms with the disaster as Turkey enters a new post-Kemalist era. The story of what happened to the Armenians in 1915-16 is well-known. Here we are told the ""history of the history"" and the lesser-known story of what happened to Armenians, Kurds, and Turks in the century that followed. De Waal relates how different generations tackled the issue of the ""Great Catastrophe"" from the 1920s until the failure of the Protocols signed by independent Armenia and Turkey in 2010. Quarrels between diaspora Armenians supporting and opposing the Soviet Union broke into violence and culminated with the murder of an archbishop in 1933. The devising of the word ""genocide,"" the growth of modern identity politics, and the 50th anniversary of the massacres re-energized a new generation of Armenians. In Turkey the issue was initially forgotten, only to return to the political agenda in the context of the Cold War and an outbreak of Armenian terrorism. More recently, Turkey has started to confront its taboos. In an astonishing revival of oral history, the descendants of tens of thousands of ""Islamized Armenians,"" who have been in the shadows since 1915, have begun to reemerge and reclaim their identities.Drawing on archival sources, reportage and moving personal stories, de Waal tells the full story of Armenian-Turkish relations since the Genocide in all its extraordinary twists and turns. He looks behind the propaganda to examine the realities of a terrible historical crime and the divisive ""politics of genocide"" it produced. The book throws light not only on our understanding of Armenian-Turkish relations but also of how mass atrocities and historical tragedies shape contemporary politics.","[""History"",""Nonfiction"",""Politics"",""War""]",2/1/2015,2015.0,"{""name"":""Thomas de Waal"",""num_books"":18,""num_followers"":""42""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":3,""reviews_percentage"":2},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":5,""reviews_percentage"":3},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":18,""reviews_percentage"":14},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":55,""reviews_percentage"":42},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":47,""reviews_percentage"":36}}","""$9.99""",external,external_focus,True

In an eye-opening tour of the unconscious, as contemporary psychological science has redefined it, Timothy D. Wilson introduces us to a hidden mental world of judgments, feelings, and motives that introspection may never show us.

This is not your psychoanalyst's unconscious. The adaptive unconscious that empirical psychology has revealed, and that Wilson describes, is much more than a repository of primitive drives and conflict-ridden memories. It is a set of pervasive, sophisticated mental processes that size up our worlds, set goals, and initiate action, all while we are consciously thinking about something else.

If we don't know ourselves―our potentials, feelings, or motives―it is most often, Wilson tells us, because we have developed a plausible story about ourselves that is out of touch with our adaptive unconscious. Citing evidence that too much introspection can actually do damage, Wilson makes the case for better ways of discovering our unconscious selves. If you want to know who you are or what you feel or what you're like, Wilson advises, pay attention to what you actually do and what other people think about you. Showing us an unconscious more powerful than Freud's, and even more pervasive in our daily life, Strangers to Ourselves marks a revolution in how we know ourselves.","[""Psychology"",""Nonfiction"",""Science"",""Philosophy"",""Self Help"",""Neuroscience"",""Personal Development"",""Sociology"",""Social Science"",""Biology""]",1/1/2002,2002.0,"{""name"":""Timothy D.

While many books have been written about the landmark battle, When the Smoke Cleared at Gettysburg differs from the rest by detailing the horrific aftermath of the battle, detailing what it takes to put a town back together after two armies have fought through its streets and across the surrounding countryside. The small town of 2,400 inhabitants was faced with the enormous problem of burying more than 7,000 dead soldiers and caring for 20,000 wounded men who had been left behind by both armies. Fields that just days earlier maintained crops and livestock were now littered with firearms, munitions, and swords, and nearly every building still standing was turned into a field hospital with mounds of amputated limbs left behind after the surgeons had completed their grizzly work.
When the Smoke Cleared at Gettysburg provides firsthand accounts of life in the town and on the battlefield in the days and months following the brutal fighting. Included are stories and vivid descriptions from soldiers, reporters, civilians, doctors, and nurses. Good Samaritans came to help the wounded and the dying, and profiteers and souvenir hunters were not far behind. Then came the politicians, followed by legions of families seeking the remains of their fallen sons.
When the Smoke Cleared at Gettysburg presents the heart-breaking human misery resulting from his battle and by the ongoing war wherever it went. From the backbreaking chore of clearing the battlefield of the wounded and dead to nursing the amputees, one can learn much of the battle by seeing what ordinary people who were pulled into the war did to survive and rebuild their lives.","[""Civil War"",""History"",""Nonfiction"",""American History""]",5/31/2003,2003.0,"{""name"":""George Sheldon"",""num_books"":93,""num_followers"":""1""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":0,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":3,""reviews_percentage"":2},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":23,""reviews_percentage"":21},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":42,""reviews_percentage"":40},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":37,""reviews_percentage"":35}}","""$16.95""",external,external_focus,True

Sir Ernest Shackleton's trans-Antarctic expedition of 1914-1917 was one of the great feats of human endurance -- one vividly captured in the powerful and dramatic pictures taken by Frank Hurley, the expedition's official photographer. These images, appearing together here for the first time in print, constitute an amazing body of photojournalism created under the most adverse circumstances imaginable. As this book reveals, however, they are far more than visual reportage; they also are images of great artistry that capture the life-and-death drama that was played out against an arctic landscape of magnificent and terrible beauty.

The story told here through Frank Hurley's lens began in the summer of 1914, when Shackleton and his crew set sail from England with the intention of being the first to cross Antarctica from one coast to the other, passing through the South Pole on the way. After five months they reached the freezing Weddell Sea and were within sight of land when the Endurance became trapped in the ice pack. Nine months later, the ship was finally crushed, leaving the crew stranded on drifting ice floes at the end of the earth.

What followed is one of the most remarkable survival stories in the history of human exploration. Shackleton's men camped on the ice floes for five months before they escaped in their lifeboats and, after a harrowing five-day voyage, reached Elephant Island, a barren outcrop too remote for any hope of rescue. From there, Shackleton and five other volunteers set out for South Georgia Island and miraculously reached their destination after traversing 850 miles of the fiercest seas on the face of the planet in an open lifeboat. There they raised help, and three months later, after three failed attempts, Shackleton made it back to Elephant Island with a rescue ship.

Incredibly, every single one of his men survived. Almost as incredible is the fact that so much of this drama was captured on film by Frank Hurley, and that so many of these pictures survived. South with Endurance is the first book to reproduce a total of nearly 500 extant photographs, including many remarkable color images that have never been published before. It is also the first to reproduce the photos to a standard and size that display Hurley's work as the art that it is. Drawn from the archives of the Royal Geographical Society in London, the State Library of New South Wales in Sydney, and the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge, the photographs are complemented by excerpts from Hurley's diary, a chapter about the expedition itself, a biographical essay, and commentary about Hurley's photographic techniques.","[""History"",""Nonfiction"",""Photography"",""Travel"",""Art"",""Adventure"",""Survival"",""Biography"",""Historical"",""20th Century""]",10/22/2001,2001.0,"{""name"":""Frank Hurley"",""num_books"":35,""num_followers"":""4""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":11,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":26,""reviews_percentage"":2},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":129,""reviews_percentage"":10},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":404,""reviews_percentage"":33},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":644,""reviews_percentage"":53}}",,external,external_focus,True

The “change” is not simply a collection of physical symptoms to be “fixed,” Dr. Northrup claims, but a mind/body revolution that brings the greatest opportunity for growth since adolescence. The choices a woman makes now–from the quality of her relationships to the quality of her diet–have the power to secure her health and well-being for the rest of her life. Through her personal story and many fascinating case histories, Dr. Northrup shows:

• How menopause jump-starts changes in the brain, issuing a dramatic wake-up call to body, mind, and emotions
• How to ensure the long-term health of breasts, bones, and heart
• How the body adjusts naturally to changing hormones
• Why bestselling drugs like Premarin may not be the best choice
• How to deal with metabolism shifts, weight gain, sexual problems, and appearance issues
• How to negotiate the challenges of “the empty nest” and midlife marriage

https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1398830.Love_and_Limerence,1398830.Love_and_Limerence,Love and Limerence: The Experience of Being in Love,"[""Dorothy Tennov""]",3.94,746,97.0,"Author Dorothy Tennov, Ph.D., on Love and Limerence:

It was over 35 years ago that, having become convinced through personal experience and the writings of others of the enormous significance of that aspect of the human reproductive process known as romantic love, I elected to explore the subject systematically.

My journey of exploration occurred in three identifiable phases. During the first phase, the Phase of Wandering and Wondering Through Questionnaires and Testimonials, I was primarily involved in other topics, but the ""love cards"" assessments, in which students anonymously selected statements that applied to them and rejected those that did not, and the paper and pencil surveys submitted to groups continued to supply evidence of the importance of the topic, and of its prevalence, but I had not advanced beyond Shakespeare in understanding. Toward the end of that first phase, my emphasis had begun to shift from answers to questions posed by an investigator to the collection of personal testimonies, those of volunteers as well as those of published autobiographers, novelists, and historians. 

Transition to the second phase, the Phase of Limerence, was abrupt. It happened in the fall of 1973. Earlier that year I had presented the first formal paper on the subject at the meetings of the American Psychological Association. That paper, titled ""Sex differences in romantic love among college students,"" was based entirely on questionnaire results. There were sex differences in pencil and paper reports, but, as I was later to learn, examination of the details of the experience revealed more sex similarities than differences in the phenotypical experience. The discovery, later that year, of people who had not, did not and apparently could not imagine themselves having the experience that I was describing, marked a turning point. By the time of a second formal paper in 1977, I had arrived at the conceptions found in Love and Limerence, and had begun to write the book. 

The third phase began with the publication of Love and Limerence. It was the Phase of Confirmation. Love and Limerence was based largely on interviews that exposed the weakness of paper and pencil assessments. The words of love admitted of different meanings. New data in the form of voluntary written testimonials poured in from readers of the book. Many of these letters used the same words: ""What you describe is exactly what happened to me."" Others thanked me for allowing them to know that they were not alone, that as crazy as the condition was, it was not a sign of mental ill-health, but a normal phenomenon. The state was one of madness, but the person undergoing the experience was not (necessarily) mad. 

In hindsight, it should not seem surprising to the human nature scientist that there should be built into us through evolution control over reproductive functioning that supercedes other motivations. According to what I refer to as Limerence Theory, limerence is an interaction between the feelings of one person and the actions of another. It appears to occur across sexual, racial, age, cultural, and other categories of humans and it endures as long as do the conditions that sustain it. When intense, it crowds other motives out of the psyche. 

It should be noted that Limerence is not synonymous with meanings customarily attached to the term ""infatuation."" Furthermore, and most importantly, it is entirely absent in some relationships and in some people. Finally, in my judgment, both limerence and nonlimerence represent normal functioning. 

Limerence presents problems for the modern individual, causing inattention to other aspects of life, especially to responsibilities and to other relationships. Limerence for someone other than the spouse is a major cause of marital and family disruption. Furthermore, the limerent's behavior may hinder rather than enhance a relationship with the desired person if a response in kind does not occur. When frustrated, limerence may produce such severe distress as to be life threatening. 

People's reaction to Limerence Theory depends partly on their acquaintance with the evidence for it and partly on personal experience. People who have not experienced limerence are baffled by descriptions of it and sometimes resistant to the evidence that it exists. To such outside observers, limerence seems pathological. Although often the subject of romantic poetry and fiction, it has been called an addiction, an indication of low self-esteem, irrational, neurotic, erotomanic, and delusional. To people who are unacquainted with it first-hand, it inconceivable that any person should assign so much importance to another person. Fortunately, direct experience is not necessary to someone who reads the evidence. There are many scientifically known phenomena that are not directly perceivable. Although self-report is traditionally regarded with suspicion by scientists, reports that are as consistent with one another as these descriptions of limerence are hard to doubt.

Baker""]",3.56,264,46.0,"Undoubtedly the most influential advocate for birth control even before the term existed, Margaret Sanger ignited a movement that has shaped our society to this day. Her views on reproductive rights have made her a frequent target of conservatives and so-called family values activists. Yet lately even progressives have shied away from her, citing socialist leanings and a purported belief in eugenics as a blight on her accomplishments. In this captivating new biography, the renowned feminist historian Jean H. Baker rescues Sanger from such critiques and restores her to the vaunted place in history she once held. Â Trained as a nurse and midwife in the gritty tenements of New Yorkâ€™s Lower East Side, Sanger grew increasingly aware of the dangers of unplanned pregnancyâ€”both physical and psychological. A botched abortion resulting in the death of a poor young mother catalyzed Sanger, and she quickly became one of the loudest voices in favor of sex education and contraception. The movement she started spread across the country, eventually becoming a vast international organization with her as its spokeswoman.Â Sangerâ€™s staunch advocacy for womenâ€™s privacy and freedom extended to her personal life as well. After becoming a wife and mother at a relatively early age, she abandoned the trappings of home and family for a globe-trotting life as a womenâ€™s rights activist. Notorious for the sheer number of her romantic entanglements, Sanger epitomized the type of â€œfree loveâ€ that would become mainstream only at the very end of her life. That she lived long enough to see the creation of the birth control pillâ€”which finally made planned pregnancy a realityâ€”is only fitting.","[""Biography"",""Nonfiction"",""History"",""Feminism"",""Biography Memoir"",""Womens"",""Womens Studies"",""Health"",""Memoir"",""American History""]",11/8/2011,2011.0,"{""name"":""Jean H.

The distinctive feature of their challenge to theistic and specifically Christian belief is expressed by Paul Ricoeur when he calls them the ""masters of suspicion."" While skepticism directs its critique to the truth or evidential basis of belief, suspicion asks two different, intimately intertwined  what are the motives that lead to this belief? and what function does it play, what work does it do for the individuals and communities that adopt it.

What suspicion suspects is that the survival value of religious beliefs depends on satisfying desires and interests that the believing soul and the believing community are not eager to acknowledge because they violate the values they profess, as when, for example, talk about justice is a mask for deep-seated resentment and the desire for revenge. For this reason, the hermeneutics of suspicion is a theory, or group of theories, of  ideology critique in Marx, genealogy in Nietzsche, and psychoanalysis in Freud.

Suspicion and Faith argues that the appropriate religious response (""the religious uses of modern atheism"") to these critiques is not to try to refute or deflect them, but rather to acknowledge their force in a process of self-examination.","[""Philosophy"",""Theology"",""Religion"",""Nonfiction"",""Cultural"",""Christian"",""Christianity"",""Atheism"",""Spirituality""]",1/1/1993,1993.0,"{""name"":""Merold Westphal"",""num_books"":37,""num_followers"":""20""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":0,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":5,""reviews_percentage"":4},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":17,""reviews_percentage"":16},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":35,""reviews_percentage"":33},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":49,""reviews_percentage"":46}}",,external,internal_focus,True

Chaput""]",4.3,622,63.0,"""People who take God seriously will not remain silent about their faith. They will often disagree about doctrine or policy, but they won't be quiet. They can't be. They'll act on what they believe, sometimes at the cost of their reputations and careers. Obviously the common good demands a respect for other people with different beliefs and a willingness to compromise whenever possible. But for Catholics, the common good can never mean muting themselves in public debate on foundational issues of human dignity. Christian faith is always personal but never private. This is why any notion of tolerance that tries to reduce faith to private idiosyncrasy, or a set of opinions that we can indulge at home but need to be quiet about in public, will always fail.""

--From the Introduction

Few topics in recent years have ignited as much public debate as the balance between religion and politics. Does religious thought have any place in political discourse? Do religious believers have the right to turn their values into political action? What does it truly mean to have a separation of church and state? The very heart of these important questions is here addressed by one of the leading voices on the topic, Charles J. Chaput, Archbishop of Denver.

While American society has ample room for believers and nonbelievers alike, Chaput argues, our public life must be considered within the context of its Christian roots. American democracy does not ask its citizens to put aside their deeply held moral and religious beliefs for the sake of public policy. In fact, it ""requires ""exactly the opposite.

As the nation's founders knew very well, people are fallible. The majority of voters, as history has shown again and again, can be uninformed, misinformed, biased, or simply wrong. Thus, to survive, American democracy depends on an engaged citizenry --people of character, including religious believers, fighting for their beliefs in the public square--respectfully but vigorously, and without apology. Anything less is bad citizenship and a form of theft from the nation's health. Or as the author suggests: Good manners are not an excuse for political cowardice.

American Catholics and other persons of goodwill are part of a struggle for our nation's future, says Charles J. Chaput. Our choices, including our political choices, matter. Catholics need to take an active, vocal, and morally consistent role in public debate. We can't claim to personally believe in the sanctity of the human person, and then act in our public policies as if we don't. We can't separate our private convictions from our public actions without diminishing both. In the words of the author, ""How we act works backward on our convictions, making them stronger or smothering them under a snowfall of alibis.""

From tech visionaries Oliver Luckett and Michael J. Casey, a groundbreaking, must-read theory of social media -- how it works, how it's changing human life, and how we can master it for good and for profit.

In barely a decade, social media has positioned itself at the center of twenty-first century life. The combined power of platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, and Vine have helped topple dictators and turned anonymous teenagers into celebrities overnight. In the social media age, ideas spread and morph through shared hashtags, photos, and videos, and the most compelling and emotive ones can transform public opinion in mere days and weeks, even attitudes and priorities that had persisted for decades.

How did this happen? The scope and pace of these changes have left traditional businesses -- and their old-guard marketing gatekeepers -- bewildered. We simply do not comprehend social media's form, function, and possibilities. It's time we did.

In The Social Organism , Luckett and Casey offer a revolutionary  social networks -- to an astonishing degree--mimic the rules and functions of biological life. In sharing and replicating packets of information known as memes, the world's social media users are facilitating an evolutionary process just like the transfer of genetic information in living things. Memes are the basic building blocks of our culture, our social DNA. To master social media -- and to make online content that impacts the world -- you must start with the Social Organism.

With the scope and ambition of The Second Machine Age and James Gleick's The Information , The Social Organism is an indispensable guide for business leaders, marketing professionals, and anyone serious about understanding our digital world -- a guide not just to social media, but to human life today and where it is headed next.","[""Business"",""Nonfiction"",""Social Media"",""Society"",""Technology"",""Science""]",11/15/2016,2016.0,"{""name"":""Oliver Luckett"",""num_books"":2,""num_followers"":""7""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":12,""reviews_percentage"":4},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":28,""reviews_percentage"":10},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":80,""reviews_percentage"":30},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":91,""reviews_percentage"":34},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":55,""reviews_percentage"":20}}","""$9.99""",external,external_focus,True

Conducting hundreds of interviews during the course of over one year reporting on the ground, Washington Post writer Wesley Lowery traveled from Ferguson, Missouri, to Cleveland, Ohio; Charleston, South Carolina; and Baltimore, Maryland; and then back to Ferguson to uncover life inside the most heavily policed, if otherwise neglected, corners of America today.

In an effort to grasp the magnitude of the response to Michael Brown's death and understand the scale of the problem police violence represents, Lowery speaks to Brown's family and the families of other victims other victims' families as well as local activists. By posing the question, ""What does the loss of any one life mean to the rest of the nation?"" Lowery examines the cumulative effect of decades of racially biased policing in segregated neighborhoods with failing schools, crumbling infrastructure and too few jobs.

Studded with moments of joy, and tragedy, They Can't Kill Us All offers a historically informed look at the standoff between the police and those they are sworn to protect, showing that civil unrest is just one tool of resistance in the broader struggle for justice. As Lowery brings vividly to life, the protests against police killings are also about the black community's long history on the receiving end of perceived and actual acts of injustice and discrimination. They Can't Kill Us All grapples with a persistent if also largely unexamined aspect of the otherwise transformative presidency of Barack Obama: the failure to deliver tangible security and opportunity to those Americans most in need of both.

After five hundred years, the most notorious mystery of the Renaissance is finally solved. The Italian Renaissance is remembered as much for intrigue as it is for art, with papal politics and infighting among Italy's many city-states providing the grist for Machiavelli's classic work on take-no-prisoners politics, The Prince. The attempted assassination of the Medici brothers in the Duomo in Florence in 1478 is one of the best-known examples of the machinations endemic to the age. While the assailants were the Medici's rivals, the Pazzi family, questions have always lingered about who really orchestrated the attack, which has come to be known as the Pazzi Conspiracy.

More than five hundred years later, Marcello Simonetta, working in a private archive in Italy, stumbled upon a coded letter written by Federico da Montefeltro, the Duke of Urbino, to Pope Sixtus IV. Using a codebook written by his own ancestor to crack its secrets, Simonetta unearthed proof of an all-out power grab by the Pope for control of Florence. Montefeltro, long believed to be a close friend of Lorenzo de Medici, was in fact conspiring with the Pope to unseat the Medici and put the more malleable Pazzi in their place.

In The Montefeltro Conspiracy, Simonetta unravels this plot, showing not only how the plot came together but how its failure (only one of the Medici brothers, Giuliano, was killed; Lorenzo survived) changed the course of Italian and papal history for generations. In the course of his gripping narrative, we encounter the period's most colorful characters, relive its tumultuous politics, and discover that two famous paintings, including one in the Sistine Chapel, contain the Medici's astounding revenge.","[""History"",""Nonfiction"",""Italy"",""Art"",""Mystery"",""Art History"",""True Crime""]",1/1/2008,2008.0,"{""name"":""Marcello Simonetta"",""num_books"":14,""num_followers"":""8""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":3,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":16,""reviews_percentage"":6},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":64,""reviews_percentage"":24},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":111,""reviews_percentage"":43},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":64,""reviews_percentage"":24}}","""$6.99""",external,internal_focus,True

Beginning as a rare female electrical engineer and daughter of a General Motors die maker, Barra spent more than thirty years building her career before becoming the first woman to ever lead a global automaker. With $155 billion in sales and 200,000 employees, GM is widely considered to be a proxy for the U.S. economy, making Barra's position arguably the most important corporate role a woman has ever held. This book describes the personal character, choices, and leadership style that enabled her to break through the glass ceiling. When 52-year-old Mary Barra was named CEO of General Motors in 2013, only people outside of the company were surprised. She had done everything from working on the factory floor to overseeing manufacturing, from improving union relations to paring down bureaucracy, and from running human resources to helping drag the company back from its 2009 bankruptcy. This book details each step of her career, and the lessons she learned along the way. Barra is most certainly a pioneer for women in business, but she's also a living lesson as to how far the right outlook, skills, and drive can take you in your career. Road to Power explores the talent and the mindset that got her all the way to the top.","[""Biography"",""Business"",""Nonfiction""]",3/16/2015,2015.0,"{""name"":""Laura Colby"",""num_books"":5,""num_followers"":""2""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":4,""reviews_percentage"":4},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":13,""reviews_percentage"":13},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":32,""reviews_percentage"":32},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":26,""reviews_percentage"":26},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":23,""reviews_percentage"":23}}","""$18.00""",external,internal_focus,True

For more than 50 years, Chimen and his wife, Miriam, hosted epic gatherings in their house of books that brought together many of the age's greatest thinkers. The atheist son of one of the century's most important rabbis, Chimen was born in 1916 near Minsk, spent his early teenage years in Moscow while his father served time in a Siberian labor camp for religious proselytizing, and then immigrated to London, where he discovered the writings of Karl Marx and became involved in left-wing politics. He briefly attended the newly established Hebrew University in Jerusalem, until World War II interrupted his studies. Back in England, he married, and for many years he and Miriam ran a respected Jewish bookshop in London's East End. When the Nazis invaded Russia in June 1941, Chimen joined the Communist Party, becoming a leading figure in the party's National Jewish Committee. He remained a member until 1958, when, shockingly late in the day, he finally acknowledged the atrocities committed by Stalin. In middle age, Chimen reinvented himself once more, this time as a liberal thinker, humanist, professor, and manuscript expert for Sotheby's auction house. Journalist Sasha Abramsky re-creates here a lost world, bringing to life the people, the books, and the ideas that filled his grandparents' house, from gatherings that included Eric Hobsbawm and Isaiah Berlin to books with Marx's handwritten notes, William Morris manuscripts and woodcuts, an early 16th-century Bomberg Bible, and a first edition of Descartes' Meditations .

Miller""]",4.21,107,39.0,"I have three children, a girl and two boys. Our worlds overlap but, already, these worlds are not the same. Their worlds, the worlds that they will grow to fill, are already taking leave of mine. Their futures are already wedged into our present. This is both heartening and frightening. So much of our world deserves to be left. So much of it deserves to be scrapped and recycled. But, too, this scares me. I worry that a lot of what has mattered most to me in this world—Mormonism in particular—may be largely unintelligible to them in theirs. This problem isn’t new, but it is perpetually urgent. Every generation must start again. Every generation must work out their own salvation. Every generation must live its own lives and think its own thoughts and receive its own revelations. And, if Mormonism continues to matter, it will be because they, rather than leaving, were willing to be Mormon all over again. Like our grandparents, like our parents, and like us, they will have to rethink the whole tradition, from top to bottom, right from the beginning, and make it their own in order to embody Christ anew in this passing world. To the degree that we can help, our job is to model that work in love and then offer them the tools, the raw materials, and the room to do it themselves.

The best way to motivate people—at school, at work, or at home—is to support their sense of autonomy. Explaining the reasons why a task is important and then allowing as much personal freedom as possible in carrying out the task will stimulate interest and commitment, and is a much more effective approach than the standard system of reward and punishment. We are all inherently interested in the world, argues Deci, so why not nurture that interest in each other?

“Change is hard,” we say, and it is even harder when change is thrust upon us. In today’s tough times, we may be forced to reinvent our career or downsize our lives; at any point in life, we may lose a love or a dream. Our first reaction to change we didn’t ask for may be to rail against fate. But what if we could see past today’s turmoil and spot the opportunities that lie within unasked-for change? That is the promise of AdaptAbility, bestselling author and executive coach M. J. Ryan’s paradigm-shifting new book on not merely surviving but thriving when change is required.

Why is it so hard to accept change? Paradoxically, it is for the very reason that our brains usually work so well; we are designed to learn something and make it automatic. The problem is that when circumstances change, our “efficient” brains keep trying to do things the same old way. In AdaptAbility, Ryan provides strategies to retrain your brain and optimize your response to change, step by  by first accepting the new reality, then expanding your options, and finally, taking effective action. She offers cutting-edge tools for becoming calmer, less fearful, and more flexible, creative, and resourceful in your thinking. Best of all, as your “adapt-ability” increases, so does your confidence that you will be able to face whatever life sends your way and find new ways to flourish.

Doch bei Roman Maria Koidl wirken sie fast wie ein PR-Gag. Zumindest seit er den Frauenversteher gibt, indem er aus Anekdoten der Gegenseite aus der Warte des Insiders schöpft. Scheißkerle lautet der betont reißerische Titel seines  ebenso desillusionierenden wie unterhaltsamen Buches. Die erklärte Absicht: Frauen um die 30, die schon aus biologischen Gründen ziemlich unter Druck stehen, einen Partner zu finden – und zwar möglichst fürs Leben, wenn sie sich Kinder wünschen –, die Augen für die Realitäten zu öffnen. Sofern es sich hier angesichts der verdächtigen Klischeehaftigkeit bei der Männerklassifizierung nicht nur um ein zusammenspintisiertes „Fake“ handelt – wovon wir einmal großzügig ausgehen wollen –, haben sich die beziehungsgeschädigten Frauen, die Koidl angeblich ihr Leid geklagt haben, erstaunlich weit geöffnet und ihn tief in ihre Seele blicken lassen. Doch Koidl nimmt nicht nur den Machismo aufs Korn, wenn er beispielsweise auffällige Verhaltensweisen wie ungewohnte Fürsorge, plötzliches Blumenschenken oder nie gekannte Hochform im Bett als sichere Indizien für Fremdgehen entlarvt, er führt auch den lustlos gewordenen Couchpotato vor, der es sich bei seiner Ersatzmutti gemütlich eingerichtet hat. Doch nicht nur die Männer kriegen ihr Fett weg. Koidl geht durchaus auch mit den typischen Machtspielchen der Frauen zu Gericht, indem er beispielsweise die auf sich selbst fixierten „Gefall-Töchter“ geißelt, denen es weniger um Sexualität geht als darum, den triebgesteuerten Männern schöne Augen zu machen und sie mit ihren körperlichen Reizen zu locken. Auch wenn der Autor im zweiten Teil dann auch noch auf Analytiker macht, der sich mit den tiefenpsychologischen Ursachen der weiblichen Sehnsüchte und ihren vorprogrammierten Enttäuschungen auseinandersetzt, eher leichte Kost als starker Tobak. – Franz Klotz","[""Nonfiction"",""Psychology""]",1/1/2010,2010.0,"{""name"":""Roman Maria Koidl"",""num_books"":9}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":4,""reviews_percentage"":5},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":13,""reviews_percentage"":16},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":34,""reviews_percentage"":43},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":22,""reviews_percentage"":27},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":6,""reviews_percentage"":7}}",,external,internal_focus,False

By gathering essays that exemplify the new thinking about matter and processes of materialization, this important collection shows how scholars are reworking older materialist traditions, contemporary theoretical debates, and advances in scientific knowledge to address pressing ethical and political challenges. In the introduction, Diana Coole and Samantha Frost highlight common themes among the distinctive critical projects that comprise the new materialisms. The continuities they discern include a posthumanist conception of matter as lively or exhibiting agency, and a reengagement with both the material realities of everyday life and broader geopolitical and socioeconomic structures.

Coole and Frost argue that contemporary economic, environmental, geopolitical, and technological developments demand new accounts of nature, agency, and social and political relationships; modes of inquiry that privilege consciousness and subjectivity are not adequate to the task. New materialist philosophies are needed to do justice to the complexities of twenty-first-century biopolitics and political economy, because they raise fundamental questions about the place of embodied humans in a material world and the ways that we produce, reproduce, and consume our material environment.

“A hopeful message for our troubled times . . . Michael Medved has an eye for a story, and a preternatural gift for telling it in beguiling ways.”—Joseph J. Ellis, Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award–winning author of Founding Brothers

Has God withdrawn his special blessing from the United States? Americans ponder that painful question in troubled times, as we did during the devastation of the Civil War and after the assassinations of the ’60s, and as we do in our present polarization. Yet somehow—on battlefields, across western wilderness, and in raucous convention halls—astounding events have reliably advanced America, restoring faith in the Republic’s providential protection.  

In this provocative historical narrative, Michael Medved brings to life ten haunting tales that reveal this purposeful pattern, including:

• A near-fatal carriage accident forces Lincoln’s secretary of state into a canvas-and-steel neck brace that protects him from a would-be assassin’s knife thrusts, allowing him two years later to acquire Alaska for the United States.
• A sudden tidal wave of Russian Jewish immigration, be­ginning in 1881, coincides with America’s rise to world leadership, fulfilling a biblical promise that those bless­ing Abraham’s children will themselves be blessed.
• Campaigning for president, Theodore Roosevelt takes a bullet in the chest, but a folded speech in his jacket pocket slows its progress and saves his life.
• At the Battle of Midway, U.S. planes get lost over empty ocean and then miraculously reconnect for five minutes of dive-bombing that wrecks Japan’s fleet, convincing even enemy commanders that higher powers intervened against them.
• A behind-the-scenes “conspiracy of the pure of heart” by Democratic leaders forces a gravely ill FDR to replace his sitting vice president—an unstable Stalinist—with future White House great Harry Truman.

These and other little-known stories build on themes of The American Miracle, Medved’s bestseller about America’s remarkable rise. The confident heroes and stubborn misfits in these pages shared a common faith in a master plan, which continues to unfold in our time. God’s Hand on America con­firms that the founders were right about America’s destiny to lead and enlighten the world.","[""History"",""Nonfiction"",""Christian"",""Politics"",""American History"",""Religion""]",11/26/2019,2019.0,"{""name"":""Michael Medved"",""num_books"":35,""num_followers"":""83""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":2,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":5,""reviews_percentage"":4},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":20,""reviews_percentage"":16},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":51,""reviews_percentage"":42},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":41,""reviews_percentage"":34}}","""$8.99""",external,external_focus,True

Do you or someone you care about experience episodes of extreme and unpredictable anger? Intense rages that threaten relationships, jobs, property-or worse? The first thing you need to know is that you are not alone. Researchers estimate that some 7 percent of Americans may at some time experience a condition called intermittent explosive disorder (IED), which is characterized by reoccurring periods of extraordinary anger, and millions more have less frequent yet equally damaging experiences with rage. The second thing you need to know is that there is help. Rage can be calmed and controlled with good advice and a practical, effective plan for change. From renowned anger expert Ronald Potter-Efron, this book breaks down rage into four  In survival rage, anger is triggered by a sense of danger or threat; feelings of helplessness can trigger impotence rage; the third type, abandonment rage, is triggered by a fear of losing a cherished relationship; and shame rage occurs when someone feels very disrespected. Rage briefly discusses how the brain functions during extreme emotion, and then it turns to the task of helping you stop episodes of rage-right now! In classic Potter-Efron style, the book places the responsibility for control squarely on the shoulders of the angry individual. There is no room in this dangerous situation for whys and becauses. Instead, Rage offers no-nonsense, step-by-step anger management tools that really work.","[""Self Help"",""Psychology"",""Nonfiction"",""Mental Health""]",1/1/2007,2007.0,"{""name"":""Ronald T.

In leading laboratories, academic and industrial, new creators are confidently amassing their powers and quietly honing their skills, while on the street their evangelists are zealously prophesying a posthuman future. For anyone who cares about preserving our humanity, the time has come for paying attention."" Trained as a medical doctor and biochemist, Dr. Kass has become one of our most provocative thinkers on bioethical issues. Now, in this brave and searching book, he also establishes himself as a prophetic voice summoning us to think deeply about the new biomedical technologies threatening to take us back to the future envisioned by Aldous Huxley in ""Brave New World."" As in Huxley's dystopia, where life has been smoothed out by genetic manipulation, psychoactive drugs and high tech amusement, our own accelerating efforts to master reproduction and genetic endowment, to retard aging, and to conquer illness, imperfection, and death itself are animated by our most humane and progressive aspirations. But we are walking too quickly down the road to physical and psychological utopia, Kass believes, without pausing to assess the potential damage to our humanity from this brave new biology. In a series of meditations on cloning, embryo research, the human genome project, the sale of organs, and the assault on mortality itself, Kass evaluates the ongoing effort to break down the natural boundaries given us and to remake the human body into an instrument of our will. What does it mean to treat nascent human life as raw material to be exploited? What does it mean to blur the line between procreation and manufacture? What are the proper limits to this project for the remaking of human nature? These are the questions we should be asking to prevent runaway scientism with its utopian longings from reshaping humankind in the image of our own choosing. Kass believes that technology has done and will continue to do wonders for our health and longevity and that we have much to be thankful for. But there is more at stake in the biological revolution that saving life and avoiding death. We must also strive to protect the ideas and practices that give us dignity and keep us human. ""Life, Liberty and the Defense of Dignity"" challenges us to confront the posthuman future that may await us by thinking deeply about the life and death issues we face today.","[""Philosophy"",""Nonfiction"",""Social Issues""]",1/1/2002,2002.0,"{""name"":""Leon R.

Nation-based histories cannot do justice to the rowdy, radical interchange of ideas around the Atlantic world during the tumultuous years from 1776 to 1804. National borders were powerless to restrict the flow of enticing new visions of human rights and universal freedom. This expansive history explores how the revolutionary ideas that spurred the American and French revolutions reverberated far and wide, connecting European, North American, African, and Caribbean peoples more closely than ever before.
 
Historian Janet Polasky focuses on the eighteenth-century travelers who spread new notions of liberty and equality. It was an age of itinerant revolutionaries, she shows, who ignored borders and found allies with whom to imagine a borderless world. As paths crossed, ideas entangled. The author investigates these ideas and how they were disseminated long before the days of instant communications and social media or even an international postal system. Polasky analyzes the paper records—books, broadsides, journals, newspapers, novels, letters, and more—to follow the far-reaching trails of revolutionary zeal. What emerges clearly from rich historic records is that the dream of liberty among America’s founders was part of a much larger picture. It was a dream embraced throughout the far-flung regions of the Atlantic world.","[""History"",""American Revolution"",""Nonfiction"",""Politics"",""Philosophy"",""World History""]",3/1/2015,2015.0,"{""name"":""Janet Polasky"",""num_books"":8,""num_followers"":""5""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":0,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":6,""reviews_percentage"":8},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":27,""reviews_percentage"":36},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":30,""reviews_percentage"":40},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":12,""reviews_percentage"":16}}","""$17.99""",external,external_focus,True

Unspeak represents an attempt by politicians, interest groups, and business corporations to say something without saying it, without getting into an argument and so having to justify itself. At the same time, it tries to unspeak — in the sense of erasing or silencing — any possible opposing point of view by laying a claim right at the start to only one way of looking at a problem. Recalling the vocabulary of George Orwell’s 1984, as an Unspeak phrase becomes a widely used term of public debate, it saturates the mind with one viewpoint while simultaneously makes an opposing view ever more difficult to enunciate.

Craig Harline begins with the story of young Jacob Rolandus, the son of a Dutch Reformed preacher, who converted to Catholicism in 1654 and ran away from home, causing his family to disown him. In the companion story, Michael Sunbloom, a young American, leaves his family's religion in 1973 to convert to Mormonism, similarly upsetting his distraught parents. The modern twist to Michael's story is his realization that he is gay, causing him to leave his new church, and upsetting his parents again—but this time the family reconciles.

Recounting these stories in short, alternating chapters, Harline underscores the parallel aspects of the two far-flung families. Despite different outcomes and forms, their situations involve nearly identical dynamics and heart-wrenching choices.

Slouching Towards Gomorrah is a penetrating, devastatingly insightful exposé of a country in crisis at the end of the millennium, where the rise of modern liberalism, which stresses the dual forces of radical egalitarianism (the equality of outcomes rather than opportunities) and radical individualism (the drastic reduction of limits to personal gratification), has undermined our culture, our intellect, and our morality. In a new Afterword, the author highlights recent disturbing trends in our laws and society, with special attention to matters of sex and censorship, race relations, and the relentless erosion of American moral values. The alarm he sounds is more sobering than  we can accept our fate and try to insulate ourselves from the effects of a degenerating culture, or we can choose to halt the beast, to oppose modern liberalism in every arena.

Yet at the opposite extreme of the spectrum, Edmund Dudley was instrumental in establishing the financial basis of the Tudor dynasty, while John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland, led victorious armies, laid the foundations of the Royal Navy, ruled as uncrowned king, and almost landed on the throne. Written by award-winning historian, Derek Wilson, The Uncrowned Kings of England charts the scandals and triumphs of this legendary clan. Foremost among the family, Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, was Queen Elizabeth's favorite for 30 years (and came the closest to marrying her), and governed the Netherlands in her name. His successor, Sir Robert Dudley, scholar, adventurer, and courtier, was one of the Queen's most audacious seadogs in the closing years of her reign, but fell foul of James I.

Many writers have understood colonial rule as either direct (French) or indirect (British), with a third variant--apartheid--as exceptional. This benign terminology, Mamdani shows, masks the fact that these were actually variants of a despotism. While direct rule denied rights to subjects on racial grounds, indirect rule incorporated them into a customary mode of rule, with state-appointed Native Authorities defining custom. By tapping authoritarian possibilities in culture, and by giving culture an authoritarian bent, indirect rule (decentralized despotism) set the pace for Africa; the French followed suit by changing from direct to indirect administration, while apartheid emerged relatively later. Apartheid, Mamdani shows, was actually the generic form of the colonial state in Africa.

 Through case studies of rural (Uganda) and urban (South Africa) resistance movements, we learn how these institutional features fragment resistance and how states tend to play off reform in one sector against repression in the other. Reforming a power that institutionally enforces tension between town and country, and between ethnicities, is the key challenge for anyone interested in democratic reform in Africa.","[""Africa"",""History"",""Nonfiction"",""Politics"",""Academic"",""Anthropology"",""African Literature"",""Theory"",""Post Colonial"",""Grad School""]",1/1/1996,1996.0,"{""name"":""Mahmood Mamdani"",""num_books"":30,""num_followers"":""105""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":2,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":7,""reviews_percentage"":2},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":42,""reviews_percentage"":16},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":100,""reviews_percentage"":39},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":105,""reviews_percentage"":41}}","""$17.60""",external,internal_focus,True

When she “accidentally” shot her husband, popular high school coach, Russ, the police were inclined to believe her—until they learned that ten years earlier, her first husband had died in a strangely similar way.
 
Sgt. Rick Buchanan’s relentless investigation into Stager’s life revealed a stunning vortex of compulsive lying, obsessive spending, and sexual promiscuity. With every new discovery, more of Barbara’s impeccable image unraveled. But the greatest shock—a damning piece of evidence Russ Stager left behind—revealed the nightmare truth about Barbara.

Many important issues—the political future of nations, the scope of business, the purchase of a house—hinge on negotiation. But negotiation is also an integral part of our everyday lives, whether you are resolving a quarrel, creating a family budget, or simply deciding where to eat lunch. Yet it’s easy to believe we’re usually at a disadvantage—that others are born negotiators, while we are not.

Nothing could be further from the truth. Negotiation is a skill that just about everyone can learn to do well. Some people enjoy it. Others do not. But everyone can cultivate it and learn how to handle common challenges such as these:

Salary negotiations: Few situations are as awkward as salary negotiations when you’re being offered a new job. The employer has the upper hand, but there are reasonable steps you can take to ensure that you are treated fairly and get the going rate for your position.

Sharp tactics: Aggressive negotiators are often not as sharp as they seem, since many rely on standard tricks that are easy to spot—if you know what to look for. Be alert for nibbling, limited authority, and double-talk tactics, among other gambits, and know how to counter them.

Haggling: Haggling is what many people hate about negotiation. But it’s possible to turn a win/lose confrontation into a mutually satisfying agreement by focusing on the interests of the two sides, which can be complementary.

Good negotiating goes beyond succeeding in the marketplace; these skills are crucial for solving conflicts of all types, getting fractious groups to work together, counseling friends in distress, persuading people to give to a charity, and generally getting anyone to accept your point of view—and they enable you to do it in ways that enhance rather than strain relationships.

Wouldn’t a course that equips you with such valuable knowledge pay for itself many times over?

The Art of Negotiating the Best Deal is exactly that course, taught by an expert negotiator, mediator, business school teacher, and former corporate attorney: Seth Freeman, an adjunct professor at New York University Stern School of Business and at Columbia University. In 24 engaging and practical lectures, Professor Freeman teaches you how to approach all phases of a negotiation and deal with a wide range of problems. You’ll learn how to negotiate effectively in both competitive and collaborative situations, always being “hard on the problem and soft on the person”—which is the key to achieving a mutually beneficial outcome.","[""Business"",""Nonfiction"",""Audiobook"",""Psychology"",""Leadership"",""Self Help"",""Communication"",""Management""]",1/1/2014,2014.0,"{""name"":""Seth Freeman"",""num_books"":7,""num_followers"":""7""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":0,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":9,""reviews_percentage"":1},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":95,""reviews_percentage"":16},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":249,""reviews_percentage"":43},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":226,""reviews_percentage"":39}}",,internal,internal_focus,False

Roller""]",3.79,513,69.0,"Few personalities from classical antiquity are more famous--yet more poorly understood--than Cleopatra VII, queen of Egypt. In this major biography, Duane Roller reveals that Cleopatra was in fact a learned and visionary leader whose overarching goal was always the preservation of her dynasty and kingdom.
Roller's authoritative account is the first to be based solely on primary materials from the Greco-Roman  literary sources, Egyptian documents (Cleopatra's own writings), and representations in art and coinage produced while she was alive. His compelling portrait of the queen illuminates her prowess as a royal administrator who managed a large and diverse kingdom extending from Asia Minor to the interior of Egypt, as a naval commander who led her own fleet in battle, and as a scholar and supporter of the arts. Even her love affairs with Julius Caesar and Marcus Antonius--the source of her reputation as a supreme seductress who drove men to their doom--were carefully crafted state  she chose these partners to insure the procreation of successors who would be worthy of her distinguished dynasty. That Cleopatra ultimately lost to her Roman opponents, Roller contends, in no way diminishes her abilities.

""Roller tells his tale smoothly and accessibly....The resulting portrait is that of a complex, many-sided figure, a potent Hellenistic ruler who could move the tillers of power as skillfully as any man, and one far and nobly removed from the 'constructed icon' of popular imagination.""

In 1987, Latif Yahia was taken to Saddam's headquarters to meet Uday, Saddam's eldest son, and told that a great honour had been bestowed upon him: that because of the great likeness between them, he had been chosen to be Uday's double. For many Iraqis it would have been the highlight of their lives, but for Latif, a peace-loving man who did not agree with Saddam's brutal regime, it was not. He refused. Following a week of torture, and realising he would be killed if he continued to refuse, Latif was forced to accept the role. After a gruesome training programme during which he was made to watch over thirty films of torture, hours of tapes of Uday, and undertake a final remodelling of his appearance, Latif was deemed ready. But it was only after the final test, a meeting with Saddam himself, that Latif made his first public appearance. And so began his life as Uday's double - a life on the perimeter of the inner circle of Saddam's eldest son, a witness to the horror of his insane life of debauchery, excess and brutality, and an experience for which he almost paid with his life on more than one occasion.

A quote from the Author:
“If I had known then what I now know about the lack of democracy and free speech in the West and how I would be treated. I would have stayed in Baghdad and taken a bullet from Uday, at least then I would have been buried in my country near my family.” 

From The Publisher:
Latif Yahia has never attained citizenship from another country, still stateless since his flight from Iraq in 1992, he attributes this to the fact that he refused to work with intelligence services against his country. There should be a distinction made between Saddam and Iraq, being against the invasion of Iraq in 2003 did not mean that he was for Saddam, he opposed the war because he knew what it would do to the Iraqi people and the country as a whole and also who would be appoionted Iraq’s new leaders and what they too were capable of. At the beginning of the invasion, Latif Yahia warned the American led forces that ‘they may remove one Saddam but they would create one hundred and they may remove one Uday but make one hundred more’. This has been proved by recent events in Iraq.

After his flight from Iraq Latif Yahia was considered by Saddam and the regime to be a Traitor, now within the new government he is considered to be a collaborator. A no win situation.

Book Description:
In 1987, Latif Yahia was taken to Saddam's headquarters to meet Uday, Saddam's eldest son, and told that a great honour had been bestowed upon him: that because of the great likeness between them, he had been chosen to be Uday's double. For many Iraqis it would have been the highlight of their lives, but for Latif, a peace-loving man who did not agree with Saddam's brutal regime, it was not. He refused. Following a week of torture, and realising he would be killed if he continued to refuse, Latif was forced to accept the role. After a gruesome training programme during which he was made to watch over thirty films of torture, hours of tapes of Uday, and undertake a final remodelling of his appearance, Latif was deemed ready. But it was only after the final test, a meeting with Saddam himself, that Latif made his first public appearance. And so began his life as Uday's double - a life on the perimeter of the inner circle of Saddam's eldest son, a witness to the horror of his insane life of debauchery, excess and brutality, and an experience for which he almost paid with his life on more than one occasion.

THE DEVIL’S DOUBLE,
is the first of 3 autobiographical books chronicling Latif Yahia’s incredible life-story. It vividly describes how Latif was forced to become Uday Hussein’s ‘fidai’ (body-double) and gives a unique insight into the extreme extravagance and cruelty of the Saddam regime. Latif survived assassination attempts and witnessed Uday’s psychotic temper, rapes, orgy parties, torture atrocities, and sadistic murders. The book has recently been made into a highly-acclaimed movie.

THE BLACK HOLE:
gives a fascinating account of what happened to Latif in Europe after he escaped from Iraq. How he was treated by western governments and the CIA. How Uday sought revenge on Latif and vice-versa. How he was offered a British passport by Saudis to murder a dissident and how they beheaded Latif’s Saudi princess lover. How Latif made and lost a fortune. How he strived in vain for a peaceful life and survived 4 more assassination attempts.

Forty Shades of Conspiracy:
brings Latif’s story right up to date by detailing his time in Ireland. His run-ins with drug-dealers, Corrupt Irish Garda officers and Irish politicians who continually denied him Irish citizenship. His despair as a beggar on the streets and the happiness he found after he met the love of his life. His reaction to Uday and Saddam’s deaths and his opinion on the current political situation in Iraq all makes fascinating reading.","[""Nonfiction"",""Biography"",""History"",""True Story"",""Autobiography"",""Politics""]",1/1/1994,1994.0,"{""name"":""Latif Yahia"",""num_books"":6,""num_followers"":""51""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":25,""reviews_percentage"":2},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":49,""reviews_percentage"":5},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":159,""reviews_percentage"":19},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":277,""reviews_percentage"":33},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":324,""reviews_percentage"":38}}","""$4.99""",external,external_focus,True

Keohane""]",3.61,178,11.0,"One of the liveliest debates in American international relations theory today concerns ""neorealism,"" a revival of the tradition that emphasizes the role of interstate power struggles in world affairs. The debate was sparked by the 1979 publication of Kenneth Waltz's Theory of International Relations, which systematized realism as a coherent, deductive theory. This volume provides a unique summary of current thinking on neorealism. Ideal for course use, it presents key portions of Waltz's book along with the most significant critical evaluations of the topic by other leading scholars.

Neorealism's supporters stress how much we can learn by focusing rigorously on the level of the international system, particularly by examining the effects of the distribution of power among states. Critics point out what they feel are neorealism's shortcomings: continuing ambiguities in the concepts of power and balance of power, the importance of internal determinants of foreign policy, difficulties of neorealist theory accounting for change, and what some regard as its tendency to ignore both history and the material conditions on which any international system rests. These issues are not merely of abstract interest, but relate to fundamental values as well as to the question of how humanity can survive in today's nuclear world.

Neorealism and Its Critics addresses these and other vital questions in its critiques of the theory, and of Waltz's book in particular. Featuring contributions by John Ruggie, Robert Cox, Richard Ashley, and Robert Gilpin, with an introductory essay by Keohane and a concluding chapter by Waltz, this book is essential reading for both students and scholars as an up-to-date assessment of neorealism.","[""Politics"",""International Relations"",""Political Science"",""Nonfiction"",""Grad School"",""Theory""]",4/15/1985,1985.0,"{""name"":""Robert O.

Atlas of the Prehistoric World is divided into three major sections, each of which offers a distinctive look at our planet's pre-history.

In ""The Changing Globe"" computer -generated global maps track the Earth's shift in topography during eighteen different geological periods.... From the rise of mountain ranges to the creation of new oceans, the world takes on its different faces through the course of eons.

""Life on Earth"" chronicles the evolution of plant and animal life, from the first single-celled microbes to land-dwelling mammals. Each of the Earth's major geological eras is profiled in its own chapter, which depicts the life forms that developed as continents drifted, volcanoes erupted, and meteorites crashed to the surface.

Martin""]",3.71,207,16.0,"You may be surprised to learn that over the last decade a revolutionary scientific research project has been taking place that’s led to major advances in how to produce what seem like miraculous results in your life, and extraordinary levels of meaning and happiness. The research (conducted by the Center for the Study of Intent) uncovered a new dimension of human development and has revolutionized the way personal growth, meaning, happiness, and ultimately advanced spiritual topics such as ‘enlightenment’ are understood. The results, if you let them, will transform the quality of your life in ways you currently cannot even imagine as possible. During the research a formula was uncovered that is so effective at producing what seems like miracles in people’s lives it began to be referred to as the “God Formula” among participants and researchers. This book outlines that formula, and is the final version of the highly successful training material that was used with research participants. These researchers became the first scientists to successfully experiment with this new developmental continuum. The result has been the discovery of a series of techniques that lead from everyday consciousness to increased daily happiness and satisfaction, and finally to enlightenment and beyond (yes, there is a beyond!). This book covers the first stages of this process. You can view a summary of the results from the research phase that related to it, and later ones  CenterForIntent.org/freedom. This book covers three primary components that combine to form a complete system of person growth, and an assortment of techniques for each component. While it provides the components, how they need to come together for maximum effectiveness will be unique to you. You’ll need to experiment with various combinations of these techniques until you find the one that works best for you. This may sound unusual. You’re probably used to reading books where the authors assert they have the one answer for everyone. The researchers at the Center tested an enormous number of techniques but didn’t find a single one that was helpful to more than a handful of individuals…when it was beneficial for anyone at all. However, they learned that there are a relatively small number of techniques that can be combined in ways that are incredibly effective. You just have to find the unique combination of these techniques that works for you right now. This book provides the distilled down wisdom from all of that testing. They were able to successfully identify core components from the methods that proved themselves. However, no one can tell you how to combine those components to get them to work best for you. People are simply too different for that to be possible. So, you’ll have to join the team, be your own scientist, and experiment! The good news is that the researchers spent an enormous amount of time and money narrowing down the possibilities for you. Most of the research participants were able to use this book to find the combination that worked for them quite quickly. It is likely the same will be true for you.It’s important that you not take the information this book contains lightly. Unlike other personal growth and self help books, this one is driven by a vast amount of actual research into what works. It was revised continually based on research participant feedback, so it’s very simple and easy to understand and use. But don’t let this simplicity fool you. Every line is there for a reason. This material has changed a lot of lives, if you’ll let it…yours can be next.","[""Self Help"",""Spirituality""]",6/8/2011,2011.0,"{""name"":""Jeffery A.

“We embarked on this journey because we believe America must overcome the racial barriers that divide us, the barriers that drive us to strike out at one another out of ignorance and fear. To do nothing is unacceptable.”
 
Sharon Leslie Morgan, a black woman from Chicago’s South Side avoids white people; they scare her. Despite her trepidation, Morgan, a descendent of slaves on both sides of her family, began a journey toward racial reconciliation with Thomas Norman DeWolf, a white man from rural Oregon who descends from the largest slave-trading dynasty in US history. Over a three-year period, the pair traveled thousands of miles, both overseas and through twenty-seven states, visiting ancestral towns, courthouses, cemeteries, plantations, antebellum mansions, and historic sites. They spent time with one another’s families and friends and engaged in deep conversations about how the lingering trauma of slavery shaped their lives.

Gather at the Table is the chronicle of DeWolf and Morgan’s journey. Arduous and at times uncomfortable, it lays bare the unhealed wounds of slavery. As DeWolf and Morgan demonstrate, before we can overcome racism we must first acknowledge and understand the damage inherited from the past—which invariably involves confronting painful truths. The result is a revelatory testament to the possibilities that open up when people commit to truth, justice, and reconciliation.

Did Joseph of Arimathea bring the holy chalice to the Isles of Avalon in Britain, or was the Grail a treasure of the heretical Cathars? Did the Grail cause the failure of King Arthur's Fellowship of the Round Table, or was it the inspiration for the Knights Templar of Jerusalem to create the tarot cards? Did the Grail carry the sacred blood of Christ, or was Mary Magdalene the lover of Jesus who carried his blood in the form of their child? Does the Church disclaim what must be its most sacred relic, or is the Grail actually in direct opposition to the Pope in Rome?

These are just some of the questions raised by this fascinating and provocative book. The enigma of the Grail is explored in a way which has never been attempted before. In this volume no less than nine major versions of the legend are retold, from sources as diverse as the pagan Celts, the courtly troubadours, the Cistercian monks and the greatest ""novelist"" of the 13th century.

Lavishly illustrated with maps, photographs of locations, and original artwork showing both the mythic Arthurian realm of knightly valor, the historical world of the twelfth century, and the living Grail legend of our own era.

Twelfth Century Europe was a time of unprecedented spiritual awakening. The Crusades to the Holy Land had returned with new esoteric secrets from the East. The heretical Cathars were challenging the authority of a divided and corrupt Church of Rome and women were at last accorded a new power and position, forming their own Courts of Love. Out of this extraordinary new age arose a legend which was to surpass all previous Western myths - that of a mystical object called the Holy Grail and a knightly Quest in search of it. Between 1190 and 1220, there was an outpouring of stories about this sacred artifact. Deemed heretical by the Church and yet said to hold the blood of the crucified Christ, the Grail chalice was supposedly brought to Britain two thousand years ago. And although the legend is set in the Arthurian Britain of the sixth century, tradition traces the cup of the last supper to a Cathar stronghold in the Pyrenees, under the guardianship of the Knights of the Temple of Jerusalem. The legend of the Holy Grail is not one story, but many, and this book explores the major, and very different, accounts which appeared within a thirty-year span. The legends of the Quest are taken from many sources including the earliest pagan tales of the Celtic Peredur, the unfinished, courtly epic of Cretien de Troyes, Le Conte del Graal, and a little-known poetic gem called the Diu Crone, or the Jeweled Crown.

The great Cistercian epic of the Vulgate Cycle, which includes the Queste del San Graal, is probably the account known best to Western readers, yet many more are examined including Perlesvaus, Joseph d'Arimathie, Merlin, the Didot-Perceval and Parzival.

Smith""]",3.75,73,14.0,"For at least two centuries, argues Mark Smith, white southerners used all of their senses--not just their eyes--to construct racial difference and define race. His provocative analysis, extending from the colonial period to the mid-twentieth century, shows how whites of all classes used the artificial binary of ""black"" and ""white"" to justify slavery and erect the political, legal, and social structure of segregation.

Based on painstaking research, How Race Is Made is a highly original, always frank, and often disturbing book. After enslaved Africans were initially brought to America, the offspring of black and white sexual relationships (consensual and forced) complicated the purely visual sense of racial typing. As mixed-race people became more and more common and as antebellum race-based slavery and then postbellum racial segregation became central to southern society, white southerners asserted that they could rely on their other senses--touch, smell, sound, and taste--to identify who was ""white"" and who was not. Sensory racial stereotypes were invented and irrational, but at every turn, Smith shows, these constructions of race, immune to logic, signified difference and perpetuated inequality.

Smith argues that the history of southern race relations and the construction of racial difference on which that history is built cannot be understood fully on the basis of sight alone. In order to come to terms with the South's past and present, Smith says, we must explore the sensory dynamics underpinning the deeply emotional construction of race. How Race Is Made takes a bold step toward that understanding.

They dominate the look of its art and commodities as well as our discourse about the ambivalent feelings these objects often inspire. In this radiant study, Sianne Ngai offers a theory of the aesthetic categories that most people use to process the hypercommodified, mass-mediated, performance-driven world of late capitalism, treating them with the same seriousness philosophers have reserved for analysis of the beautiful and the sublime.

Ngai explores how each of these aesthetic categories expresses conflicting feelings that connect to the ways in which postmodern subjects work, exchange, and consume. As a style of performing that takes the form of affective labor, the zany is bound up with production and engages our playfulness and our sense of desperation. The interesting is tied to the circulation of discourse and inspires interest but also boredom. The cute’s involvement with consumption brings out feelings of tenderness and aggression simultaneously. At the deepest level, Ngai argues, these equivocal categories are about our complex relationship to performing, information, and commodities.

Through readings of Adorno, Schlegel, and Nietzsche alongside cultural artifacts ranging from Bob Perelman’s poetry to Ed Ruscha’s photography books to the situation comedy of Lucille Ball, Ngai shows how these everyday aesthetic categories also provide traction to classic problems in aesthetic theory. The zany, cute, and interesting are not postmodernity’s only meaningful aesthetic categories, Ngai argues, but the ones best suited for grasping the radical transformation of aesthetic experience and discourse under its conditions.","[""Philosophy"",""Art"",""Nonfiction"",""Theory"",""Sociology"",""Literary Criticism"",""Cultural Studies"",""Criticism"",""Essays"",""21st Century""]",10/15/2012,2012.0,"{""name"":""Sianne Ngai"",""num_books"":11,""num_followers"":""128""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":5,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":4,""reviews_percentage"":1},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":21,""reviews_percentage"":7},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":123,""reviews_percentage"":41},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":142,""reviews_percentage"":48}}",,external,external_focus,True

In the wake of the 2004 presidential election, the Religious Right insisted that George Bush had been handed a mandate for an ideology-based social agenda, including the passage of a “marriage amendment” to ban same-sex unions, diversion of tax money to religious groups through “faith-based initiatives,” the teaching of creationism in public schools, and restrictions on abortion. Led by an aggressive band of television preachers and extremist radio personalities, the Religious Right set its sights on demolishing the wall of separation between church and state.

The Reverend Barry Lynn is a devout Christian, but this propaganda effort disturbs him deeply. He argues that politicians need to stop looking to the Bible to justify their actions and should consult another source  the U.S. Constitution.

When the Founding Fathers of our great nation created the Constitution, they had seen firsthand the dangers of an injudicious mix of religion and government. They knew what it was like to live under the yoke of state-imposed faith. They drew up a model for the new nation that would allow absolute freedom of religion. They knew that religion, united with the raw power of government, spawns tyranny.

Yet the Religious Right now seems distrustful of those principles inherent in the Constitution, viewing the separation of church and state only as a dangerous anti-Christian principle imposed upon our nation. In reality, the separation between church and state has been an important ally to  with the state out of the picture, hundreds of religions have grown and prospered. Religion doesn’t need the government’s assistance, any more than it is practical or appropriate for religious doctrine to be fostered in the government or taught in public schools.

As an explicitly religious figure speaking out against the Religious Right, Lynn has incurred the wrath of such personalities as Pat Buchanan, Jerry Falwell, and Pat Robertson, who once said Lynn was “lower than a child molester.” Lynn has continuously taken on these radicals of the Religious Right calmly and rationally, using their own statements and religious fervor to prove that when they attack the constitutionally mandated separation, they’re actually attacking freedom of religion.

In Piety & Politics , the Reverend Barry Lynn continues the fight—educating Americans about what is at stake, explaining why it is crucial that we maintain the separation of church and state, and galvanizing us to defend the honor of our religious freedom.","[""Politics"",""Religion"",""Nonfiction"",""Christianity"",""Social Issues"",""History""]",1/1/2006,2006.0,"{""name"":""Barry W.

He shows how boredom is, in fact, one of our most common and constructive emotions and is an essential part of the human experience. This informative and entertaining investigation of boredom—what it is and what it isn't, its uses and its dangers—spans more than 3,000 years of history and takes readers through fascinating neurological and psychological theories of emotion, as well as recent scientific investigations, to illustrate its role in our lives. There are Australian aboriginals and bored Romans, Jeffrey Archer and caged cockatoos, Camus and the early Christians, Dürer and Degas. Toohey also explores the important role that boredom plays in popular and highbrow culture and how over the centuries it has proven to be a stimulus for art and literature. Toohey shows that boredom is a universal emotion experienced by humans throughout history and he explains its place, and value, in today's world.

Created in 1811 by a three-man commission featuring headstrong Founding Father Gouverneur Morris, the plan called for a dozen parallel avenues crossing at right angles with many dozens of parallel streets in an unbroken grid. Hills and valleys, streams and ponds, forests and swamps were invisible to the grid; so too were country villages, roads, farms, and estates and generations of property lines. All would disappear as the crosshatch fabric of the grid overspread the  a heavy greatcoat on the land, the dense undergarment of the future city.

No other grid in Western civilization was so large and uniform as the one ordained in 1811. Not without reason. When the grid plan was announced, New York was just under two hundred years old, an overgrown town at the southern tip of Manhattan, a notorious jumble of streets laid at the whim of landowners. To bring order beyond the chaos-and good real estate to market-the street planning commission came up with a monolithic grid for the rest of the island. Mannahatta-the native ""island of hills""-became a place of rectangles, in thousands of blocks on the flattened landscape, and many more thousands of right-angled buildings rising in vertical mimicry.

The Manhattan grid has been called ""a disaster"" of urban planning and ""the most courageous act of prediction in Western civilization."" However one feels about it, the most famous urban design of a living city defines its daily life.

Language is not pure. Language is not only words. Language is not divided into real languages and ""dialects"". Language is not what we write on a page. So what, then, is a language? John McWhorter asks us to do a simple thing: to look at language the way a linguist does. And once we make that leap, we see a whole new world of human communication, celebrating everything from ancient Persian to the Navajo language to ""baby mama"". 

What Language Is argues that any language, left untouched, becomes more ingrown over time. Only adults attempting to learn a language (and constructively butchering it) can strip it down. Diving into the astounding complexities of Navajo, McWhorter outlines how a language can become downright disheveled, with more exceptions than rules. Looking at an African language called Twi, McWhorter elucidates how even tongues that sound primitive to the untrained ear enfold immense intricacies, and how what sounds like ""improper"" language actually constitute new and exciting grammar. McWhorter then examines the difference between written and oral language, and explains that, to a linguist, the notion that the written word is somehow elevated over the spoken in downright bizarre, especially because only two hundred of the world's six thousand languages are written. McWhorter also looks at the way languages cross-pollinate each other and occasionally become entirely new creatures via the example of Saramaccan, a wonderful languages that combines African languages with English, Dutch, and Portuguese.","[""Linguistics"",""Language"",""Nonfiction"",""Science"",""History"",""Adult"",""Sociology"",""Psychology"",""Anthropology"",""Writing""]",8/4/2011,2011.0,"{""name"":""John McWhorter"",""num_books"":48,""num_followers"":""1572""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":15,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":26,""reviews_percentage"":3},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":187,""reviews_percentage"":24},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":346,""reviews_percentage"":44},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":195,""reviews_percentage"":25}}",,external,internal_focus,False

Applying the logic of strategy for which he is well known, Luttwak argues that the most populous nation on Earth and its second largest economy may be headed for a fall.

For any country whose rising strength cannot go unnoticed, the universal logic of strategy allows only military or economic growth. But China is pursuing both goals simultaneously. Its military buildup and assertive foreign policy have already stirred up resistance among its neighbors, just three of whom India, Japan, and Vietnam together exceed China in population and wealth. Unless China's leaders check their own ambitions, a host of countries, which are already forming tacit military coalitions, will start to impose economic restrictions as well.

Chinese leaders will find it difficult to choose between pursuing economic prosperity and increasing China's military strength. Such a change would be hard to explain to public opinion. Moreover, Chinese leaders would have to end their reliance on ancient strategic texts such as Sun Tzu's ""Art of War"". While these guides might have helped in diplomatic and military conflicts within China itself, their tactics such as deliberately provoking crises to force negotiations turned China s neighbors into foes. To avoid arousing the world's enmity further, Luttwak advises, Chinese leaders would be wise to pursue a more sustainable course of economic growth combined with increasing military and diplomatic restraint.","[""China"",""Politics"",""Nonfiction"",""History"",""Economics"",""International Relations"",""Asia""]",10/19/2012,2012.0,"{""name"":""Edward N.

The book is arranged in two  the first surveys the comparative modes of thought and varying success of Byzantine, Latin-Christian, and Muslim cultures, and the second takes the reader from the eleventh-century revival of learning to the high Middle Ages and beyond, the period in which the vibrancy of Western intellectual culture enabled it to stamp its imprint well beyond the frontiers of Christendom.

Marcia Colish argues that the foundations of the Western intellectual tradition were laid in the Middle Ages and not, as is commonly held, in the Judeo-Christian or classical periods. She contends that Western medieval thinkers produced a set of tolerances, tastes, concerns, and sensibilities that made the Middle Ages unlike other chapters of the Western intellectual experience. She provides astute descriptions of the vernacular and oral culture of each country of Europe; explores the nature of medieval culture and its transmission; profiles seminal thinkers (Augustine, Anselm, Gregory the Great, Aquinas, Ockham); studies heresy from Manichaeism to Huss and Wycliffe; and investigates the influence of Arab and Jewish writing on scholasticism and the resurrection of Greek studies. Colish concludes with an assessment of the modes of medieval thought that ended with the period and those that remained as bases for later ages of European intellectual history.","[""History"",""Philosophy"",""Nonfiction"",""Medieval"",""Medieval History"",""Academic"",""European History"",""Church History""]",1/1/1997,1997.0,"{""name"":""Marcia L.

Few women realize that most popular fitness regimens are designed for men. Yet women have their own unique fitness needs — and using a program developed with men’s bodies in mind is not only ineffective, but can actually result in injury.

Renowned physical therapist Peggy Brill has devoted her life to developing an exercise program specifically for women. Based on her understanding of movement dynamics and body structure, these exercises focus on developing and balancing the muscles in the anatomical center of the body — the core — which includes the back, hip and abdominal muscles.

Peggy’s remarkable head-to-toe workout targets the “hot spot” areas — neck, back, pelvis, hips, knees — that cause problems for even the healthiest women. In just 15 minutes a day, The Core Program ’s easy-to-learn exercises will help women:

• Strengthen their bodies to achieve balance and alignment
• Eliminate everyday aches and pains
• Prevent bone loss
• Protect against osteoarthritis
• Improve sleep, digestion and circulation
• Enjoy better sex
• Feel energized all day long
• Overcome the effects of aging

With inspirational case histories, detailed photographs illustrating each exercise and self-tests for rating balance, flexibility and strength, The Core Program is an owner’s manual for the naturally strong, healthy body every woman should have.","[""Health"",""Fitness"",""Nonfiction"",""Self Help"",""Reference""]",8/28/2001,2001.0,"{""name"":""Peggy W.

Every second we create more of our past—more decisions, more breathing, more love and more loathing, all of it slides by into the gone as we race to grab at more moments, at more memories made and already fading.

We are all authors, creators of our own pasts, of the books that will be our lives. We stare at the future or obsess about the present, but only the past has been set in stone, and we are the ones setting it. When we race across the wet concrete of time without purpose, without goals, without laughter and love and sacrifice, then we fail in our mortal moment. We race toward our inevitable ends without artistry and without beauty.

All of us must pause and breathe. See the past, see your life as the fruit of providence and thousands of personal narratives. What led to you? You did not choose where to set your feet in time. You choose where to set them next.

Then, we must see the future, not just to stare into the fog of distant years but to see the crystal choices as they race toward us in this sharp foreground we call the present. We stand in the now.

As a contributing editor for the National Guitar Workshop, he wrote about musical subjects ranging from the Grammy Awards to Tuvan throat-singing. For WorkshopLive, NGW’s online learning platform, he interviewed guitar, bass and piano teachers about their views on practicing, performing and playing. He has created content for online courses in guitar instruction, folk music, bluegrass and country music, and advised the Boy Scouts of America on the requirements for the Music Merit Badge. Tom has also taught guitar, performed in the rockabilly band Real Gone, arranged the music of George Gershwin and Duke Ellington for solo acoustic guitar and written dozens of songs.

For two and a half millennia, the story of the city and its catastrophic downfall has inspired people--from Francis Bacon to Jules Verne to Jacques Cousteau--to speculate on the island's origins, nature, and location, and sometimes even to search for its physical remains. It has endured as a part of the mythology of many different cultures, yet there is no indisputable evidence, let alone proof, that Atlantis ever existed. What, then, accounts for its seemingly inexhaustible appeal?

Richard Ellis plunges into this rich topic, investigating the roots of the legend and following its various manifestations into the present. He begins with the story's origins. Did it arise from a common prehistorical myth? Was it a historical remnant of a lost city of pre-Columbians or ancient Egyptians? Was Atlantis an extraterrestrial colony? Ellis sifts through the ""scientific"" evidence marshaled to ""prove"" these theories, and describes the mystical and spiritual significance that has accrued to them over the centuries. He goes on to explore the possibility that the fable of Atlantis was inspired by a conflation of the high culture of Minoan Crete with the destruction wrought on the Aegean world by the cataclysmic eruption, around 1500 b.c., of the volcanic island of Thera (or Santorini).

A fascinating historical and archaeological detective story, Imagining Atlantis is a valuable addition to the literature on this essential aspect of our mythohistory.","[""Nonfiction"",""History"",""Mythology"",""Folklore"",""Ancient""]",1/1/1998,1998.0,"{""name"":""Richard   Ellis"",""num_books"":29,""num_followers"":""52""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":5,""reviews_percentage"":5},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":16,""reviews_percentage"":17},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":38,""reviews_percentage"":40},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":29,""reviews_percentage"":31},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":5,""reviews_percentage"":5}}","""$4.99""",external,external_focus,True

Nineteen-year-old Alice Mitchell had planned to pass as a man in order to marry her seventeen-year-old fiancée Freda Ward, but when their love letters were discovered, they were forbidden from ever speaking again.

Freda adjusted to this fate with an ease that stunned a heartbroken Alice. Her desperation grew with each unanswered letter—and her father’s razor soon went missing. On January 25, Alice publicly slashed her ex-fiancée’s throat. Her same-sex love was deemed insane by her father that very night, and medical experts agreed: This was a dangerous and incurable perversion. As the courtroom was expanded to accommodate national interest, Alice spent months in jail—including the night that three of her fellow prisoners were lynched (an event which captured the attention of journalist and civil rights activist Ida B. Wells). After a jury of ""the finest men in Memphis"" declared Alice insane, she was remanded to an asylum, where she died under mysterious circumstances just a few years later.

Children have become the center of the universe, ruling the roost with some serious ramifications for their wellbeing. By trying to constantly please their children and make them happy, parents are actually making their children anxious. In attempting to veer from the strictness of their own upbringing, many parents have gone too far the other way, showering praise onto their children in the hope of increasing self-esteem, forgetting that self-control is a key to instilling self-confidence. 

Dr. Robin Berman’s extensive clinical experience has helped parents and children navigate the emotional and psychological minefields of family dynamics. In this essential parenting guide, she strikes the perfect balance of advice, anecdote, and research, explaining why parents need to be in charge and providing the tools they can use to give their children what they really need: limits, time, and more love.
 
Ten Tips from Permission to Parent

Parenting is not a democracy. Rules make kids feel safe.

Don’t be emotionally bullied by your child. Emotionally wimpy parenting leads to emotionally fragile kids.

A child who has too much power often becomes anxious.
Catering to your child’s every whim can lead to a child who is self-centered and lacks empathy.

Look long-term at a child who hasn’t faced consequences for behavior and, therefore, never learned accountability: Would you want to date this person as an adult?

If you say, “If you do that one more time,” mean it. Consistent follow-through is essential for a child’s emotional safety and your sanity.

Keep your eye on the long-term goal of raising a lovely child. Remember your mantra:  Hate me now, thank me later.

Talk less, give fewer choices, keep it simple. Less is clearly more.

No is a complete sentence. No does not begin a negotiation.
Reverse negotiate. The more they argue, the less they get. It works like a charm.","[""Parenting"",""Nonfiction"",""Childrens"",""Self Help"",""Adult"",""Family"",""Psychology""]",4/29/2014,2014.0,"{""name"":""Robin Berman"",""num_books"":2,""num_followers"":""11""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":43,""reviews_percentage"":6},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":127,""reviews_percentage"":19},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":257,""reviews_percentage"":39},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":218,""reviews_percentage"":33}}","""$11.99""",internal,external_focus,False

Wilson""]",4.47,103,19.0,"A new edition of a classic  the complete Bayeux Tapestry in color with an introduction, description, and commentary by a leading authority on the period In a museum in the small town of Bayeux in Normandy, specially devised to hold this single object, is a strip of linen nearly one thousand years old. It is 230 feet long and about 20 inches high. On it, embroidered in brightly colored wool, are figures of men, animals, buildings, and ships. In a series of vivid scenes, with a running explanatory text in Latin, it relates the invasion of England by William of Normandy and his victory at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Nothing remotely like the Bayeux Tapestry exists anywhere in the world, yet comparatively few people have been to Bayeux to see it and appreciate how totally absorbing it is. This book, first published in 1985, reproduces the Tapestry in full color and makes it accessible as never before. The story told in the Tapestry has all the ingredients of an epic poem, and a cast of characters that includes King Edward the Confessor; his liegeman, Duke Harold; and William, Duke of Normandy. When Edward dies, Harold succeeds him as king. William, who has a better dynastic claim, invades England, and at the Battle of Hastings Harold is defeated and killed. Here the Tapestry breaks off, but it probably originally concluded with William's coronationthe beginning of a sequence of monarchs that has continued virtually unbroken until today, and of the English nation as we know it. The Tapestry is reproduced in full color over 146 pages, with captions on a fold-out page for easy reference. A second reproduction of the Tapestry in black and white has a detailed accompanying commentary. Sir David Wilson, former Director of the British Museum, provides an up-to-date summary of the historical evidence, explaining each episode and covering related topics such as the costumes, armor, ships, buildings, and customs. One of the primary sources for the history of the period, the Tapestry is a social document of incalculable value. It is the sole survivor of an art form that may once have been widespread, the wall-hanging commemorating the deeds of a great man.","[""History"",""Art"",""Nonfiction"",""France"",""Medieval"",""Academic"",""Historical"",""Medieval History""]",1/1/1985,1985.0,"{""name"":""David M.

Research has shown that when teachers, schools, and districts take a systematic approach to helping students identify and master essential vocabulary and concepts of a given subject area, student comprehension and achievement rises.

In the manual, readers will find the following 

- A method to help teachers, schools, and districts determine which academic vocabulary terms are most essential for their needs

- A six-step process for direct instruction in subject area vocabulary

- A how-to to help students use the Building Academic  Student Notebook. The six-step method encourages students to learn critical academic vocabulary by connecting these terms to prior knowledge using linguistic and non-linguistic means that further encourage the refinement and deepening of their understanding.

- Suggestions for tailoring academic vocabulary procedures for English Language Learners.

- Samples and blackline masters for a variety of review activities and games that reinforce and refine student understanding of the academic terms and concepts they learn.

The book also includes a list of 7,923 vocabulary terms culled from the national standards documents and other publications, organized into 11 subject areas and 4 grade-level categories. It puts into practice the research and ideas outlined in Marzano's previous book Building Background Knowledge for Academic Achievement. Using the teacher's manual and vocabulary notebooks, educators can guide students in using tools and activities that will help them deepen their own understanding of critical academic vocabulary, the building blocks for achievement in each discipline.","[""Education"",""Teaching"",""Nonfiction"",""Linguistics""]",1/1/2005,2005.0,"{""name"":""Robert J.

Madoff claimed to have stolen fifty billion dollars; the sum seemed impossibly large. But of course it wasn't impossible. And that was only the beginning of the story. As chief investigative correspondent for ABC News, Brian Ross has been on the front lines of the Madoff scandal since the beginning. Throughout the course of his investigation, he and his team have achieved unequaled access to the investigators working to unravel Madoff's fraud, and have succeeded in cultivating sources deep within the walls of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities that no other journalist has reached. Ross was even able to obtain a copy of the contents of Madoff's ""little black book."" The result is an unparalleled, fly-on-the-wall view of a life of corrupted luxury and outrageous lies. Ross chronicles the lavish lifestyle that Bernie and his high-school sweetheart, Ruth, enjoyed as the result of his ill-gotten gains and the bone-deep deceit that shocked the world with its sheer audacity. He details the layers of Madoff's scheme--from money men across the country who made millions convincing clients to entrust their wealth to Madoff, to the fabricated stock trades and false quarterly statements that fooled his victims, many of whom lost their savings, their homes, some of them even their lives, in the wake of Madoff's betrayal. This is a true-crime drama of Shakespearean proportions, built upon the up-close investigative skills of one of our most respected journalists.

The narrow passageways were suddenly filled with men and then as suddenly cleared as each man fitted into his assigned position.  The USS Seawolf was one of the greatest submarine raiders of all time.  Having narrowly avoided the attack on Pearl Harbor the Seawolf set out for the seas of the Pacific to wreak havoc on Japanese shipping.  Joseph Melvin Eckberg was on the Seawolf from her maiden voyage and remained with her until January 1943. As chief radioman he was instrumental in assisting Captain Frederick Warder to find and destroy enemy targets.  From the claustrophobia of being trapped under water and the overwhelming fear of depth charges to the joys of aiding the war-effort and the camaraderie on the ship, Eckberg’s account, told to the authors Gerold Frank and James Horan, gives remarkable insight into submarine warfare of the Second World War.  “It is a narrative straight as a sword, from which emerges the story of how that happy marriage of courage and skill was achieved which made our submarines more than any other group the fleet that won the war.” The Saturday Review, Fletcher Pratt.  “The successes of the Seawolf bear testimony to the effectiveness of single-purposeness and teamwork.” Jonas H.

It is clear that the events of 1917, whatever you think of them, deserve study.”

This book reveals, from the perspective of one of its central actors, the Russian Revolution’s profoundly democratic, emancipatory character.

Originally published in three parts, Trotsky’s masterpiece is collected here in a single volume. It serves as the most vital and inspiring record of the Russian Revolution to date.

“[T]he greatest history of an event that I know.”
—C. L. R. James

“In Trotsky all passions were aroused, but his thought remained calm and his vision clear.... His involvement in the struggle, far from blurring his sight, sharpens it.... The History is his crowning work, both in scale and power and as the fullest expression of his ideas on revolution. As an account of a revolution, given by one of its chief actors, it stands unique in world literature.”

""Easily the best book on Orson Welles.""  --The New Yorker

Orson Welles arrived in Hollywood as a boy genius, became a legend with a single perfect film, and then spent the next forty years floundering. But Welles floundered so variously, ingeniously, and extravagantly that he turned failure into ""a sustaining tragedy""--his thing, his song.  Now the prodigal genius of the American cinema finally has the biographer he deserves. For, as anyone who has read his novels and criticism knows, David Thomson is one of our most perceptive and splendidly opinionated writers on film.

In Rosebud, Thomson follows the wild arc of Welles's career, from The War of the Worlds broadcast to the triumph of Citizen Kane, the mixed triumph of The Magnificent Ambersons, and the strange and troubling movies that followed. Here, too, is the unfolding of the Welles persona--the grand gestures, the womanizing, the high living, the betrayals. Thomson captures it all with a critical acumen and stylistic dash that make this book not so much a study of Welles's life and work as a glorious companion piece to them.

2018 Michigan Notable Books honoree

The author of Baldwin’s Harlem looks at the evolving culture, politics, economics, and spiritual life of Detroit—a blend of memoir, love letter, history, and clear-eyed reportage that explores the city’s past, present, and future and its significance to the African American legacy and the nation’s fabric.

Herb Boyd moved to Detroit in 1943, as race riots were engulfing the city. Though he did not grasp their full significance at the time, this critical moment would be one of many he witnessed that would mold his political activism and exposed a city restless for change. In Black Detroit, he reflects on his life and this landmark place, in search of understanding why Detroit is a special place for black people.

Boyd reveals how Black Detroiters were prominent in the city’s historic, groundbreaking union movement and—when given an opportunity—were among the tireless workers who made the automobile industry the center of American industry. Well paying jobs on assembly lines allowed working class Black Detroiters to ascend to the middle class and achieve financial stability, an accomplishment not often attainable in other industries.

Boyd makes clear that while many of these middle-class jobs have disappeared, decimating the population and hitting blacks hardest, Detroit survives thanks to the emergence of companies such as Shinola—which represent the strength of the Motor City and and its continued importance to the country. He also brings into focus the major figures who have defined and shaped Detroit, including William Lambert, the great abolitionist, Berry Gordy, the founder of Motown, Coleman Young, the city’s first black mayor, diva songstress Aretha Franklin, Malcolm X, and Ralphe Bunche, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize.

With a stunning eye for detail and passion for Detroit, Boyd celebrates the music, manufacturing, politics, and culture that make it an American original.","[""History"",""Nonfiction"",""Race"",""African American"",""Politics"",""Urban Studies"",""American History"",""Memoir"",""Social Justice"",""Historical""]",6/6/2017,2017.0,"{""name"":""Herb Boyd"",""num_books"":38,""num_followers"":""37""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":4,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":14,""reviews_percentage"":4},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":101,""reviews_percentage"":32},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":125,""reviews_percentage"":40},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":63,""reviews_percentage"":20}}","""$1.99""",external,external_focus,True

Is aging without illness possible?

Is your own internal fountain of youth waiting to be discovered?

Yes, yes, and YES! says Suzanne Somers, the bestselling author of The Sexy Years . It can all be true when you take advantage of the new science of antiaging medicine—a revolutionary approach to achieving the ageless life.

Suzanne Somers introduced millions of women to bioidentical hormone replacement therapy and changed the way we look at menopause with her groundbreaking book, The Sexy Years , and the overwhelming media response to its publication. Now, in Ageless , Suzanne introduces an inspiring, medically validated approach to reversing the aging process and maintaining a healthy, vibrant, mentally sharp, sexually active life—while building the body’s natural defenses against age-related diseases.

Ageless is jam-packed with new, updated information on bioidentical hormone replacement and antiaging that will change your life forever. Suzanne talks about:

• Antiaging medicine and how it can help work against the environmental assault that is making us sick, including how to detox the body of harmful pollutants and chemicals and strengthen our weakest glands and organs

• Menopause, which can become an enjoyable passage once the body is in perfect hormonal sync with bioidentical hormone replacement therapy

• The dangers of perimenopause and how women can treat it

• Why so many hysterectomies are unnecessary, how birth control pills may have contributed to the rise of hysterectomies, and how to restore your body to perfect hormonal balance after having one

• How andropause is a real condition for men, and how men can lose weight, regain their youthful physiques, and restore heath, energy, and sexuality, all through bioidentical HRT

• The importance of sleep and the healing work that nature does during this time to balance hormones and increase energy

In this “antiaging bible,” Suzanne brings together prominent, Western-trained antiaging doctors who are at the forefront of a medical revolution to show how the traditional medical approach is woefully inadequate and outdated. Its standard of care has been to treat all symptoms with drugs, but in Ageless you will find out how this approach does not make us better. With antiaging medicine you can heal your body rather than keep a chronic condition at bay with drugs. Ageless shows you how to keep your “insides” young, and how this manifests on the outside.

What could be better than having your doctor tell you that you have the bones of a twenty-year-old, or the heart of a thirty-year-old? You can be young on the inside if you follow the advice in Ageless . Suzanne reveals the secrets to youthfulness that everyone can achieve and shows us all how to live the ageless life!


How young is your energy?

“The second half of your life can be better than your first half. A better life, a healthier life, a life of youthful energy comes from embracing antiaging medicine, and bioidentical hormone replacement is a big component. . . . The second half of life can be wonderful. I know it because I am living it. This new approach to health gives you back your lean body, shining hair, and thick skin, provided you are eating correctly and exercising in moderation. This new medicine allows your brain to work perfectly and offers the greatest defense against cancer, heart attack, and Alzheimer’s disease. Don’t you want that?” —From the Introduction

The familiar epithet conveys all the principal features of his indomitable  courage, valor, prowess, the pursuit of glory, the thirst for fame, generosity in war and peace, a sense of honor combined with a sort of haughty dignity made up of both arrogance and pride. In this book, Jean Flori examines both Richard's role as prince and king in history, and also analyses the different and sometimes controversial elements which, for the chroniclers of his day, helped to make Richard a true model of chivalry.

Among the questions addressed  What influences formed his character and determined his behavior, real or assumed? Why did the image of Richard as a king who was also a knight so quickly and so soon supplant all others, creating a quasi-definitive point of reference? Why did Richard deliberately, it would appear, choose to present himself in this chivalric guise and disseminate this image of himself by what we would today call a media campaign, using all the methods then at his disposal, limited perhaps but by no means ineffective? Last but not least, what is the historical and ideological significance of the choice and, even more, success of this image, which has been adopted by history and disseminated by legend, an image based on historical accounts and documents in which history and legend are sometimes inextricably interwoven? The first part of the book takes a straightforward chronological approach to Richard's life, from his birth in 1157, through conflict with his father, Henry II, and his brothers, to his coronation and his years of crusading and fighting the French; culminating in his death in battle in 1199. The second part analyses Richard's image in relation to medieval chivalry.","[""History"",""Nonfiction"",""France"",""Biography"",""British Literature""]",1/1/1999,1999.0,"{""name"":""Jean Flori"",""num_books"":47,""num_followers"":""5""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":3,""reviews_percentage"":4},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":0,""reviews_percentage"":0},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":26,""reviews_percentage"":41},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":23,""reviews_percentage"":36},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":11,""reviews_percentage"":17}}","""$12.99""",external,external_focus,True

Copenhaver""]",3.73,143,30.0,"A rich, wondrous anthology of the Western magical tradition, from the Old Testament to  Doctor Faustus  and  Paradise Lost , in a beautiful hardcover edition
 
“. . . as when iron is drawn to a magnet, camphor is sucked into hot air, crystal lights up in the Sun, sulfur and a volatile liquid are kindled by flame, an empty eggshell filled with dew is raised towards the Sun . . .”
 
The Bible is full of stories featuring forms of magic and possession—from Moses battling with Pharaoh’s wizards to the supernatural actions of Jesus and his disciples. As, over the following centuries, the Christian church attempted to stamp out “deviant” practices, a persistent interest in magic drew strength from this Biblical validation. A strange blend of mumbo-jumbo, fear, fraud, and deeply serious study, magic was at the heart of the European Renaissance, fascinating many of its greatest figures.
 
This is a book filled with incantations, charms, curses, summonings, cures, and descriptions of extraordinary, shadowy, only half-understood happenings from long ago. It features writers as various as Thomas Aquinas, John Milton, John Dee, Ptolemy, and Paracelsus along with anonymous ancient and medieval works that were, in some cases, viewed as simply too dangerous even to open.
 
The Book of Magic will be welcomed by everyone from those with the most casual interest in the magical tradition to anyone drawn to the Renaissance and the tangled, arcane roots of the scientific tradition.

She’s Barbie—an icon of femininity to generations of American girls. She’s also multiethnic and straight—or so says Mattel, Barbie’s manufacturer. But, as Barbie’s Queer Accessories demonstrates, many girls do things with Barbie never seen in any commercial. Erica Rand looks at the corporate marketing strategies used to create Barbie’s versatile (She’s a rapper! She’s an astronaut! She’s a bride!) but nonetheless premolded and still predominantly white image. Rand weighs the values Mattel seeks to embody in Barbie—evident, for example, in her improbably thin waist and her heterosexual partner—against the naked, dyked out, transgendered, and trashed versions favored by many juvenile owners and adult collectors of the doll.
Rand begins by focusing on the production and marketing of Barbie, starting in 1959, including Mattel’s numerous tie-ins and spin-offs. These variations, which include the much-promoted multiethnic Barbies and the controversial Earring Magic Ken, helped make the doll one of the most profitable toys on the market. In lively chapters based on extensive interviews, the author discusses adult testimony from both Barbie ""survivors"" and enthusiasts and explores how memories of the doll fit into women’s lives. Finally, Rand looks at cultural reappropriations of Barbie by artists, collectors, and especially lesbians and gay men, and considers resistance to Barbie as a form of social and political activism.
Illustrated with photographs of various interpretations and alterations of Barbie, this book encompasses both Barbie glorification and abjection as it testifies to the irrefutably compelling qualities of this bestselling toy.

Again and again, the outnumbered Australians risked everything to stop the Japanese from advancing along the track towards mainland Australia. 

Conditions on the track were hellish - rain was constant, the terrain close to inhospitable, food and ammunition supplies were practically non-existent and the men constantly battled malaria and dysentery, as well as the Japanese. The Australian troops were wounded and exhausted beyond belief, but always found that extra bit of spirit to fight on, with the help of the local people.

“My dad’s family was a mystery,” writes prize-winning journalist Joe Mozingo. Growing up, he knew that his mother’s ancestors were from France and Sweden, but he heard only suspiciously vague stories about where his father’s family was from—Italy, Portugal, the Basque country. Then one day, a college professor told him his name may have come from sub-Saharan Africa, which made no sense at  Mozingo was a blueeyed white man from the suburbs of Southern California. His family greeted the news as a lark—his uncle took to calling them “Bantu warriors”—but Mozingo set off on a journey to find the truth of his roots.

He soon discovered that all Mozingos in America, including his father’s line, appeared to have descended from a black man named Edward Mozingo who was brought to the Jamestown colony as a slave in 1644 and won his freedom twenty-eight years later. He became a tenant farmer growing tobacco by a creek called Pantico Run, married a white woman, and fathered one of the country’s earliest mixed-race family lineages.

But Mozingo had so many more questions to answer. How had it been possible for Edward to keep his African name? When had some of his descendants crossed over the color line, and when had the memory of their connection to Edward been obscured? The journalist plunged deep into the scattered historical records, traveled the country meeting other Mozingos—white, black, and in between—and journeyed to Africa to learn what he could about Edward’s life there, retracing old slave routes he may have traversed.

The Fiddler on Pantico Run is the beautifully written account of Mozingo’s quest to discover his family’s lost past. A captivating narrative of both personal discovery and historical revelation that takes many turns, the book traces one family line from the ravages of the slave trade on both sides of the Atlantic, to the horrors of the Jamestown colony, to the mixed-race society of colonial Virginia and through the brutal imposition of racial laws, when those who could pass for white distanced themselves from their slave heritage, yet still struggled to rise above poverty. The author’s great-great-great-great-great grandfather Spencer lived as a dirt-poor white man, right down the road from James Madison, then moved west to the frontier, trying to catch a piece of America’s manifest destiny. Mozingos fought on both sides of the Civil War, some were abolitionists, some never crossed the color line, some joined the KKK. Today the majority of Mozingos are white and run the gamut from unapologetic racists to a growing number whose interracial marriages are bringing the family full circle to its mixed-race genesis.

Tugging at the buried thread of his origins, Joe Mozingo has unearthed a saga that encompasses the full sweep of the American story and lays bare the country’s tortured and paradoxical experience with race and the ways in which designations based on color are both illusory and life altering. The Fiddler on Pantico Run is both the story of one man’s search for a sense of mooring, finding a place in a continuum of ancestors, and a lyrically written exploration of lineage, identity, and race in America.

From The Fiddler on Pantico Run

As I listened to the dry rasp of the elephant grass, I gazed out over the Kingdom of Kom. A narrow gorge threaded through the lush terrain below, opening into a smoky blue chasm in the distance, the Valley of Too Many Bends. . . . This belt of fertile savannah in western Cameroon rested at a terrible crossroads, with no forest to hide in when the marauders arrived. The kings may have been safe in their fortified isolation, but their people were not. They were taken first by Arab invaders in the Sudan in the north, and then by the southern peoples who found that humans were the commodity Europeans most desired. . . .

Those who survived had been handed from tribe to tribe, through too many hostile foreign territories to dream of escaping and returning home. And then off they went, into the sea.

High on a ridge, three hundred miles by road from the Atlantic, I sat at the headwaters of that outward movement, imagining the people flowing away like the rivers below. I pictured a boy, gazing down into that blue mountain cradle, the grass dry-swishing in the breeze, the drums coming up in the night. A boy suddenly pulled into the current and scrambling to reach the bank. A boy unable to imagine the ocean and sickly white men in big wooden ships and the swampy, malarial settlement called Jamestown where he would be sold to a planter in the year of their lord 1644.

This is the beginning, I said to myself. The beginning of my family’s story, the point just after which my forebears obscured the truth—and nearly buried it forever.","[""Nonfiction"",""History"",""Biography"",""Memoir"",""Africa"",""Family"",""The United States Of America"",""Biography Memoir"",""Historical"",""Race""]",10/2/2012,2012.0,"{""name"":""Joe Mozingo"",""num_books"":1,""num_followers"":""2""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":2,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":10,""reviews_percentage"":4},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":66,""reviews_percentage"":27},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":101,""reviews_percentage"":41},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":62,""reviews_percentage"":25}}","""$14.99""",external,external_focus,True

https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/166195.Modern_Operating_Systems,166195.Modern_Operating_Systems,Modern Operating Systems,"[""Andrew S. Tanenbaum""]",4.14,2093,67.0,"For software development professionals and computer science students, Modern Operating Systems gives a solid conceptual overview of operating system design, including detailed case studies of Unix/Linux and Windows 2000.     What makes an operating system modern? According to author Andrew Tanenbaum, it is the awareness of high-demand computer applications--primarily in the areas of multimedia, parallel and distributed computing, and security. The development of faster and more advanced hardware has driven progress in software, including enhancements to the operating system. It is one thing to run an old operating system on current hardware, and another to effectively leverage current hardware to best serve modern software applications. If you don't believe it, install Windows 3.0 on a modern PC and try surfing the Internet or burning a CD.     Readers familiar with Tanenbaum's previous text, Operating Systems, know the author is a great proponent of simple design and hands-on experimentation. His earlier book came bundled with the source code for an operating system called Minux, a simple variant of Unix and the platform used by Linus Torvalds to develop Linux. Although this book does not come with any source code, he illustrates many of his points with code fragments (C, usually with Unix system calls).     The first half of Modern Operating Systems focuses on traditional operating systems concepts: processes, deadlocks, memory management, I/O, and file systems. There is nothing groundbreaking in these early chapters, but all topics are well covered, each including sections on current research and a set of student problems. It is enlightening to read Tanenbaum's explanations of the design decisions made by past operating systems gurus, including his view that additional research on the problem of deadlocks is impractical except for ""keeping otherwise unemployed graph theorists off the streets.""    It is the second half of the book that differentiates itself from older operating systems texts. Here, each chapter describes an element of what constitutes a modern operating system--awareness of multimedia applications, multiple processors, computer networks, and a high level of security. The chapter on multimedia functionality focuses on such features as handling massive files and providing video-on-demand. Included in the discussion on multiprocessor platforms are clustered computers and distributed computing. Finally, the importance of security is discussed--a lively enumeration of the scores of ways operating systems can be vulnerable to attack, from password security to computer viruses and Internet worms.     Included at the end of the book are case studies of two popular operating systems: Unix/Linux and Windows 2000. There is a bias toward the Unix/Linux approach, not surprising given the author's experience and academic bent, but this bias does not detract from Tanenbaum's analysis. Both operating systems are dissected, describing how each implements processes, file systems, memory management, and other operating system fundamentals.      Tanenbaum's mantra is simple, accessible operating system design. Given that modern operating systems have extensive features, he is forced to reconcile physical size with simplicity. Toward this end, he makes frequent references to the Frederick Brooks classic The Mythical Man-Month for wisdom on managing large, complex software development projects. He finds both Windows 2000 and Unix/Linux guilty of being too complicated--with a particular skewering of Windows 2000 and its ""mammoth Win32 API."" A primary culprit is the attempt to make operating systems more ""user-friendly,"" which Tanenbaum views as an excuse for bloated code. The solution is to have smart people, the smallest possible team, and well-defined interactions between various operating systems components. Future operating system design will benefit if the advice in this book is taken to heart. --Pete Ostenson","[""Computer Science"",""Programming"",""Technical"",""Technology"",""Nonfiction"",""Software"",""Reference"",""Computers"",""Textbooks"",""Science""]",1/1/1992,1992.0,"{""name"":""Andrew S.

Companies from the United States and around the globe are flocking there to buy, sell, manufacture, and create new products. But as former Wall Street Journal China bureau chief turned successful corporate executive James McGregor explains, business in China is conducted with a lot of subterfuge -- nothing is as it seems and nothing about doing business in China is easy. Destined to become the bible for business people in China, One Billion Customers shows how to navigate the often treacherous waters of Chinese deal-making. Brilliantly written by an author who has lived in China for nearly two decades, the book reveals indispensable, street-smart strategies, tactics, and lessons for succeeding in the world's fastest growing consumer market.

""Hereabouts died a very gallant gentleman, Captain L. E. G. Oates of the Inniskilling Dragoons. In March 1912, returning from the Pole, he walked willingly to his death in a blizzard to try to save his comrades, beset by hardship.""

—Inscription on a cross placed near presumed final resting place of Antarctic explorer Lawrence “Titus” Oates, The Terra Nova Expedition, 1910-1913



“We have one survival bag for every two people.”

“When the ice cracks, it can sound like massive thunder rolls that seem to go on forever. If it is a serious cracking in the ice, it literally sounds like canon shots.”

—Eighth-grade science teacher and Antarctic diver Robin Ellwood, Lake Ecosystems in Antarctica Project, 2008-2009



Humanity’s fascination with the land at the bottom of the globe dates back at least to the ancient Romans, who imagined Terra Australis Incognita—the “unknown southern land”—and drew it on their maps even though no one had ever seen it. It took a thousand years for this unknown land to become known. Despite the many people who have since visited it, conquering the Antarctic frontier is a never-ending challenge that calls scientists and explorers to risk their lives in the pursuit of knowledge.



Frozen Secrets is the tale of a continent, the inside story of the critical, cutting-edge research that brave men and women from around the world have done and still do in Antarctica. Sally M. Walker traces expeditions from the earliest explorers to today’s research stations, where contemporary scientists work in some of the harshest conditions on Earth.



Whether they study the formation of polar ice or the stratigraphy of ancient rock or the fossils of newly discovered dinosaurs or the chemistry of air trapped in miniscule frozen bubbles, the scientists working in Antarctica are building a body of knowledge that will influence future generations as they make choices that could affect the course of the whole planet.","[""Nonfiction"",""Science"",""Nature"",""Childrens""]",10/1/2010,2010.0,"{""name"":""Sally M.

And it doesn’t exist. Located a mere seventy-five miles outside of Las Vegas in Nevada’s desert, the base has never been acknowledged by the U.S. government-but Area 51 has captivated imaginations for decades.

Myths and hypotheses about Area 51 have long abounded, thanks to the intense secrecy enveloping it. Some claim it is home to aliens, underground tunnel systems, and nuclear facilities. Others believe that the lunar landing itself was filmed there. The prevalence of these rumors stems from the fact that no credible insider has ever divulged the truth about his time inside the base. Until now.

Annie Jacobsen had exclusive access to nineteen men who served the base proudly and secretly for decades and are now aged 75-92, and unprecedented access to fifty-five additional military and intelligence personnel, scientists, pilots, and engineers linked to the secret base, thirty-two of whom lived and worked there for extended periods. In Area 51, Jacobsen shows us what has really gone on in the Nevada desert, from testing nuclear weapons to building super-secret, supersonic jets to pursuing the War on Terror.

This is the first book based on interviews with eye witnesses to Area 51 history, which makes it the seminal work on the subject. Filled with formerly classified information that has never been accurately decoded for the public, Area 51 weaves the mysterious activities of the top-secret base into a gripping narrative, showing that facts are often more fantastic than fiction, especially when the distinction is almost impossible to make.","[""Nonfiction"",""History"",""Science"",""Military Fiction"",""Politics"",""Audiobook"",""War"",""Conspiracy Theories"",""American History"",""Military History""]",5/17/2011,2011.0,"{""name"":""Annie Jacobsen"",""num_books"":9,""num_followers"":""1964""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":165,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":559,""reviews_percentage"":6},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":2236,""reviews_percentage"":25},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":3426,""reviews_percentage"":39},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":2348,""reviews_percentage"":26}}","""$12.99""",external,external_focus,True

What happened to him during nearly three years far behind enemy lines is the amazing story that John Keats tells in They Fought Alone.For Fertig, with the aid of a handful of Americans who also refused to surrender, led thousands of Filipinos in a seemingly hopeless war against the Japanese. They made bullets from curtain rods; telegraph wire from iron fence. They fought off sickness, despair and rebellion within their own forces. Their homemade communications were MacArthur’s eyes and ears in the Philippines. When the Americans finally returned to Mindanao, they found Fertig virtually in control of one of the world’s largest islands, commanding an army of 35,000 men, and at the head of a civil government with its own post office, law courts, currency, factories, and hospitals.John Keats, who also served in the Philippines, has captured all the pain, brutality, and courage of this incredible drama, in which many memorable men and women play their parts.

Searching far beyond our modern world's honking horns and buzzing machinery, he has sought out the truly wild places that remain, where natural soundscapes exist virtually unchanged from when the earliest humans first inhabited the earth.

Krause shares fascinating insight into how deeply animals rely on their aural habitat to survive and the damaging effects of extraneous noise on the delicate balance between predator and prey. But natural soundscapes aren't vital only to the animal kingdom; Krause explores how the myriad voices and rhythms of the natural world formed a basis from which our own musical expression emerged.

From snapping shrimp, popping viruses, and the songs of humpback whales-whose voices, if unimpeded, could circle the earth in hours-to cracking glaciers, bubbling streams, and the roar of intense storms; from melody-singing birds to the organlike drone of wind blowing over reeds, the sounds Krause has experienced and describes are like no others. And from recording jaguars at night in the Amazon rain forest to encountering mountain gorillas in Africa's Virunga Mountains, Krause offers an intense and intensely personal narrative of the planet's deep and connected natural sounds and rhythm.

The Great Animal Orchestra is the story of one man's pursuit of natural music in its purest form, and an impassioned case for the conservation of one of our most overlooked natural resources-the music of the wild.","[""Music"",""Nonfiction"",""Science"",""Nature"",""Animals"",""Environment"",""Natural History"",""History"",""Biology"",""Ecology""]",1/1/2012,2012.0,"{""name"":""Bernie Krause"",""num_books"":23,""num_followers"":""34""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":6,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":33,""reviews_percentage"":5},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":137,""reviews_percentage"":22},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":228,""reviews_percentage"":38},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":195,""reviews_percentage"":32}}","""$10.99""",external,external_focus,False

The Waste Makers was the first book to probe the increasing commercialization of American life—the development of consumption for consumption's sake. Packard outlines the ways manufacturers and advertisers persuade consumers to buy things they don't need and didn't know they wanted, including the two-of-a-kind of everything syndrome—""two refrigerators in every home""—and appeals to purchase something because it is more expensive, or because it is painted in a new color. The book also brought attention to the concept of planned obsolescence, in which a ""death date"" is built into products so that they wear out quickly and need to be replaced. By manipulating the public into mindless consumerism, Packard believed that business was making us ""more wasteful, imprudent, and carefree in our consuming habits,"" which was using up our natural resources at an alarming rate. A prescient book that predicted the rise of American consumer culture, this all new edition of The Waste Makers features an introduction by best-selling author Bill McKibben. Vance Packard (1914-1996) was an American journalist, social critic, and best-selling author.

The First World War was a truly global conflict from the start, with many of the most decisive battles fought in or directly affecting the Balkans, Africa, and the Ottoman Empire. Even more than World War II, the First World War continues to shape the politics and international relations of our world, especially in hot spots like the Middle East and the Balkans. Strachan has done a masterful job of reexamining the causes, the major campaigns, and the consequences of the First World War, compressing a lifetime of knowledge into a single definitive volume tailored for the general reader. Written in crisp, compelling prose and enlivened with extraordinarily vivid photographs and detailed maps, The First World War re-creates this world-altering conflict both on and off the battlefield—the clash of ideologies between the colonial powers at the center of the war, the social and economic unrest that swept Europe both before and after, the military strategies employed with stunning success and tragic failure in the various theaters of war, the terms of peace and why it didn’t last. Drawing on material culled from many countries, Strachan offers a fresh, clear-sighted perspective on how the war not only redrew the map of the world but also set in motion the most dangerous conflicts of today. Deeply learned, powerfully written, and soon to be released with a new introduction that commemorates the hundredth anniversary of the outbreak of the war, The First World War remains a landmark of contemporary history.  ","[""History"",""Nonfiction"",""World War I"",""War"",""Military History"",""Military Fiction"",""World History"",""Historical"",""European History"",""20th Century""]",1/1/2003,2003.0,"{""name"":""Hew Strachan"",""num_books"":66,""num_followers"":""63""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":41,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":138,""reviews_percentage"":5},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":653,""reviews_percentage"":26},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":984,""reviews_percentage"":39},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":692,""reviews_percentage"":27}}","""$12.99""",external,external_focus,True

It is the extraordinary tale of an exceptional woman, Katherine Swynford, who became first the mistress and later the wife of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster.

Katherine Swynford’s charismatic lover was one of the most powerful princes of the 14th century, the effective ruler of England behind the throne of his father Edward III in his declining years, and during the minority of his nephew, Richard ll. Katherine herself was enigmatic and intriguing, renowned for her beauty, and regarded by some as dangerous. Her existence was played out against the backdrop of court life at the height of the age of chivalry and she knew most of the great figures of the time — including her brother-in-law, Geoffrey Chaucer. She lived through much of the Hundred Years War, the Black Death, and the Peasants’ Revolt. She knew loss, adversity, and heartbreak, and she survived them all triumphantly. Although Katherine’s story provides unique insights into the life of a medieval woman, she was far from typical in that age. She was an important person in her own right, a woman who had remarkable opportunities, made her own choices, flouted convention, and took control of her own destiny — even of her own public image.

Weir brilliantly retrieves Katherine Swynford from the footnotes of history and gives her life and breath again. Perhaps the most dynastically important woman within the English monarchy, she was the mother of the Beauforts and through them the ancestress of the Yorkist kings, the Tudors, the Stuarts, and every other sovereign since — a legacy that has shaped the history of Britain.","[""History"",""Biography"",""Nonfiction"",""Historical"",""Medieval"",""British Literature"",""14th Century"",""Biography Memoir"",""Medieval History"",""Womens""]",1/27/2009,2009.0,"{""name"":""Alison Weir"",""num_books"":80,""num_followers"":""7654""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":177,""reviews_percentage"":3},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":346,""reviews_percentage"":6},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1272,""reviews_percentage"":23},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":2045,""reviews_percentage"":37},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1680,""reviews_percentage"":30}}","""$10.99""",external,external_focus,True

It's what you have if you're a politician and you've strayed from your wife, and it's why five times as many Americans undergo plastic surgery and cosmetic procedures today than did just ten years ago. It's the value that parents teach their children with song lyrics like ""I am special. Look at me,"" the skill teenagers and young adults obsessively hone on Facebook and MySpace, and the reason high school students physically beat classmates and then broadcast their violence on YouTube for all to see. It's the message preached by prosperity gospel and the vacuous ethos spread by celebrity newsmakers. And it's what's making people depressed, lonely, and buried under piles of debt.Jean M. Twenge's influential and controversial first book, Generation Me, generated a national debate with its trenchant depiction of the challenges twenty- and thirtysomethings face emotionally and professionally in today's world -- and the fallout these issues create for older generations as well as employers. Now, Dr. Twenge is on to a new incendiary topic that has repercussions for every age-group and class: the pernicious spread of narcissism in today's culture and its catastrophic effects. Dr. Twenge joins forces with W. Keith Campbell, Ph.D., a nationally recognized expert on narcissism, for The Narcissism Epidemic, their eye-opening exposition of the alarming rise of narcissism -- and they show how to stop it.Every day, you encounter the real costs of narcissism: in your relationships and family, in the workplace and the economy at large, in schools that fail to teach necessary skills, in culture, and in politics. Even the world economy has been damaged by risky, unrealistic overconfidence. Filled with arresting anecdotes that illustrate the hold narcissism has on us today -- from people hiring fake paparazzi in order to experience feeling famous to college students who won't leave a professor's office until their B+ becomes an A -- The Narcissism Epidemic is at once a riveting window into the consequences of narcissism, a probing analysis of the culture at large, and a prescription to combat the widespread problems caused by narcissism. As a society, we have a chance to slow the epidemic of narcissism once we learn to identify it, minimize the forces that sustain and transmit it, and treat it where we find it.

In this sensitive, imaginative, and original work, Gary Anderson shows how changing conceptions of sin and forgiveness lay at the very heart of the biblical tradition. Spanning nearly two thousand years, the book brilliantly demonstrates how sin, once conceived of as a physical burden, becomes, over time, eclipsed by economic metaphors. Transformed from a weight that an individual carried, sin becomes a debt that must be repaid in order to be redeemed in God's eyes. Anderson shows how this ancient Jewish revolution in thought shaped the way the Christian church understood the death and resurrection of Jesus and eventually led to the development of various penitential disciplines, deeds of charity, and even papal indulgences. In so doing it reveals how these changing notions of sin provided a spur for the Protestant Reformation.

He experiences first hand the reality of epic journeys, such as those made by Hernan Cortes, and Francisco and Gonzalo Pizarro, and explores the turbulent and terrifying events surrounding the Spanish conquest of the Aztec and Inca empires, as well as Orellanas extraordinary voyage of discovery down the Amazon and Cabeza de Vacas journey across America to the Pacific. In Peru, as in Mexico, the conquistadors swept away the indigenous states, subjugating the native people, destroying their religion and culture. As well as bringing history alive with evocative text and stunning pictures, Michael Wood grapples with the moral legacy of the European invasion. The stories in this book are not only of conquest, heroism and greed, but of changes in the way we see the world in our view of history and civilization, justice and human rights.","[""History"",""Nonfiction"",""Spain"",""Audiobook"",""World History"",""Travel"",""War"",""Historical"",""European History"",""The Americas""]",1/1/2000,2000.0,"{""name"":""Michael Wood"",""num_books"":172,""num_followers"":""293""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":6,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":33,""reviews_percentage"":3},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":202,""reviews_percentage"":22},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":395,""reviews_percentage"":44},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":249,""reviews_percentage"":28}}","""$12.99""",external,external_focus,True

The price of gas and food are climbing, unemployment remains high, the housing market has tanked, consumer and government debt is soaring, and the recovery is slowing. Facing the prospect of a second collapse of the global economy, humanity is desperate for a sustainable economic game plan to take us into the future.

Here, Jeremy Rifkin explores how Internet technology and renewable energy are merging to create a powerful ""Third Industrial Revolution."" He asks us to imagine hundreds of millions of people producing their own green energy in their homes, offices, and factories, and sharing it with each other in an ""energy internet,"" just like we now create and share information online.

Rifkin describes how the five-pillars of the Third Industrial Revolution will create thousands of businesses, millions of jobs, and usher in a fundamental reordering of human relationships, from hierarchical to lateral power, that will impact the way we conduct commerce, govern society, educate our children, and engage in civic life.

Rifkin's vision is already gaining traction in the international community. The European Union Parliament has issued a formal declaration calling for its implementation, and other nations in Asia, Africa, and the Americas, are quickly preparing their own initiatives for transitioning into the new economic paradigm.

Covering both the new regime's proud achievements and its disappointing failures, Allister Sparks looks to South Africa's future, asking whether it can overcome its history and current global trends to create a truly nonracial, multicultural, and multiparty democracy.

Sparks sees South Africa as facing many of the same challenges as the rest of the world, especially a widening gap between rich and poor, exacerbated by the forces of globalization. While the transition government has done much to establish democracy and racial equality in a short time, as well as bring basic services such as clean water to millions who did not have them before, many blacks feel it has not done enough to redress the continuing imbalance of wealth in the country. Many whites, meanwhile, feel disempowered and confused about what role they have to play as a racial minority in a country they used to rule and regard as theirs by divine right. Sparks also covers other burning issues, such as the HIV/AIDS epidemic, high crime rates, the diamond wars, the Congo conflict, and the Zimbabwean land crisis.

Writing vividly and often quite movingly, Sparks draws on his decades of journalistic experience and his recent insider access to key figures in the liberation government to take stock of where South Africa has been, where it's going, and why the rest of the world should not turn away from this country where the First and Third Worlds meet. As Sparks persuasively argues, the success of Mandela's vision of a peaceful ""rainbow nation"" is crucial not just for the salvation of Africa, but also for the world.


“Sparks, a grandfather of South African journalism, has fired one of the first volleys in the 10-year assessment. . . . It is an even-handed work, almost encyclopedic in its breadth. Sparks traverses all the important political terrain.”— Mail & Guardian

From political and social obscurity he seized control of the reins of government and became the first leader of his people in a war of liberation against a far larger and richer enemy--England--that would last for more than 60 years.

Robert Peace was born outside Newark in a ghetto known as ""Illtown."" His unwed mother worked long hours in a kitchen. His charismatic father was later convicted of a double murder. Peace's intellectual brilliance and hard-won determination earned him a full scholarship to Yale University. At college, while majoring in molecular biophysics and biochemistry, he straddled the world of academia and the world of the street, never revealing his full self in either place. Upon graduation from Yale, he went home to teach at the Catholic high school he'd attended, slid into the drug trade, and was brutally murdered at age thirty.

That's the short version of Robert Peace's life. The long version, the complete version, is this remarkable tour de force by Jeff Hobbs, a talented young novelist who was Peace's college roommate. Hobbs attended Peace's funeral, reached out to his friends from both Yale and Newark, and ultimately decided to write this harrowing and beautiful account of his life.

What does the haunting, untimely death of one man mean? Robert Peace's life doesn't reduce to easy sociological constructions. Through Hobbs's relentless research and remarkable writing, we learn the cost of living between the world Peace was born into and the one his potential allowed him to enter. We see him work, love, fail, succeed, give to others, care for his mother, travel, and dream. We witness the decisions he made for himself and the ones that life forced upon him. But most importantly, we come to understand the sheer complexity of his existence and are irrevocably changed by the fascinating, devastating, and unforgettable life of Robert Peace.","[""Nonfiction"",""Biography"",""Memoir"",""Race"",""Biography Memoir"",""Audiobook"",""African American"",""True Crime"",""History"",""Education""]",9/23/2014,2014.0,"{""name"":""Jeff Hobbs"",""num_books"":5,""num_followers"":""477""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":455,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":918,""reviews_percentage"":3},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":4152,""reviews_percentage"":15},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":10592,""reviews_percentage"":39},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":11031,""reviews_percentage"":40}}","""$12.99""",external,external_focus,True

We still face the challenge of fostering ownership and accountability throughout our organizations. Despite all the evidence calling for profound change, most organizations still rely on patriarchy and control as their core form of governance. The result is that they stifle initiative and spirit and alienate people from the work they do. This in the face of an increasing need to find ways to be responsive to customers and the wider community. 
 
Peter Block insists that what is required is a dramatic shift in how we distribute power, privilege, and the control of money. “Stewardship,” he writes, “means giving people at the bottom and the boundaries of the organization choice over how to serve a customer, a citizen, a community. It is the willingness to be accountable for the well-being of the larger organization by operating in service, rather than in control, of those around us.”
 
Block has revised and updated the book throughout, including a new introduction addressing what has changed—and what hasn’t—in the twenty years since the book was published and a new chapter on applying stewardship to the common good of the wider community. He covers both the theory of stewardship (in particular how it ameliorates the shortcomings of traditional leadership) and the practice (how it transforms every function and department for the better).

—Doris Kearns Goodwin, bestselling author of Team of Rivals and The Bully Pulpit

Leaders are always trying to get better, which is why there is an enormous and growing collection of literature offering the latest leadership paradigm or process. But sometimes the best way to move forward is to look back. Philip Barlag shows us that Julius Caesar is one of the most compelling leaders of the past to study—a man whose approach was surprisingly modern and extraordinarily effective. 

History is littered with leaders hopelessly out of touch with their people and ruthlessly pursuing their own ambitions or hedonistic whims. But Caesar, who rose from impoverished beginnings, proved by his words and deeds that he never saw himself as being above the average Roman citizen. And he had an amazing ability to generate loyalty, to turn enemies into allies and allies into devoted followers. 

Barlag uses dramatic and colorful incidents from Caesar's career—being held hostage by pirates, charging headlong alone into enemy lines, pardoning people he knew wanted him dead—to illustrate what Caesar can teach leaders today. Central to Barlag's argument is the distinction between force and power. Caesar avoided using brute force on his followers, understanding that fear never generates genuine loyalty. He exercised a power deeply rooted in his demonstrated personal integrity and his intuitive understanding of people's deepest needs and motivations. His supporters followed him because they wanted to, not because they were compelled to. Over 2,000 years after Caesar's death, this is still the kind of loyalty every leader wants to inspire. Barlag shows how anyone can learn to lead like Caesar.","[""Nonfiction"",""History"",""Leadership"",""Biography"",""Self Help"",""Business""]",10/17/2016,2016.0,"{""name"":""Phillip Barlag"",""num_books"":5,""num_followers"":""7""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":7,""reviews_percentage"":3},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":14,""reviews_percentage"":7},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":47,""reviews_percentage"":26},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":54,""reviews_percentage"":30},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":57,""reviews_percentage"":31}}","""$11.99""",internal,internal_focus,False

More than 70 years after the Nazi camps were liberated by the Allies, a new Canadian Holocaust memoir details the rural Hungarian deportations to Auschwitz-Birkenau, back-breaking slave labour in Auschwitz I, the infamous “death march” in January 1945, the painful aftermath of liberation, a journey of physical and psychological healing.

Tibor “Max” Eisen was born in Moldava, Czechoslovakia into an Orthodox Jewish family. He had an extended family of sixty members, and he lived in a family compound with his parents, his two younger brothers, his baby sister, his paternal grandparents and his uncle and aunt. In the spring of1944--five and a half years after his region had been annexed to Hungary and the morning after the family’s yearly Passover Seder--gendarmes forcibly removed Eisen and his family from their home. They were brought to a brickyard and eventually loaded onto crowded cattle cars bound for Auschwitz-Birkenau. At fifteen years of age, Eisen survived the selection process and he was inducted into the camp as a slave labourer.

One day, Eisen received a terrible blow from an SS guard. Severely injured, he was dumped at the hospital where a Polish political prisoner and physician, Tadeusz Orzeszko, operated on him. Despite his significant injury, Orzeszko saved Eisen from certain death in the gas chambers by giving him a job as a cleaner in the operating room. After his liberation and new trials in Communist Czechoslovakia, Eisen immigrated to Canada in 1949, where he has dedicated the last twenty-two years of his life to educating others about the Holocaust across Canada and around the world.

If only I could wear those clothes, belong to that group, drive that car, live in that house, be (or be with) that person? Postrel identifies the three essential elements in all forms of glamour and explains how they work to create a distinctive sensation of projection and yearning.The Power of Glamour is the very first book to explain what glamour really is—not just style or a personal quality but a phenomenon that reveals our inner lives and shapes our decisions, large and small. By embodying the promise of a different and better self in different and better circumstances, glamour stokes ambition and nurtures hope, even as it fosters sometimes-dangerous illusions.From vacation brochures to military recruiting ads, from the Chrysler Building to the iPad, from political utopias to action heroines, Postrel argues that glamour is a seductive cultural force. Its magic stretches beyond the stereotypical spheres of fashion or film, influencing our decisions about what to buy, where to live, which careers to pursue, where to invest, and how to vote.The result is myth shattering: a revelatory theory that explains how glamour became a powerful form of nonverbal persuasion, one that taps into our most secret dreams and deepest yearnings to influence our everyday choices.","[""Fashion"",""Nonfiction"",""Art"",""Business"",""Design"",""Psychology"",""Cultural"",""History"",""Sociology"",""Essays""]",1/1/2013,2013.0,"{""name"":""Virginia Postrel"",""num_books"":9,""num_followers"":""93""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":5,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":17,""reviews_percentage"":5},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":60,""reviews_percentage"":20},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":128,""reviews_percentage"":42},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":88,""reviews_percentage"":29}}","""$22.99""",external,internal_focus,True

Nuclear weapons restored strategic parity, erasing the advantage of India's much larger size and conventional military superiority. Yet in the years that followed Pakistan went on to lose decisively to India. It lost any ability to stake a serious claim to Kashmir, a region it called its jugular vein. Its ability to influence events in Afghanistan diminished. While India's growing economy won it recognition as a rising world power, Pakistan became known as a failing state. Pakistan had lost to India before but the setbacks since 1998 made this defeat irreversible.Defeat is an Orphan follows the rollercoaster ride through post-nuclear India-Pakistan, from bitter conflict in the mountains to military confrontation in the plains, from the hijacking of an Indian plane to the assault on Mumbai. Nuclear weapons proved to be Pakistan's undoing. They encouraged a reckless reliance on militant proxies even as the jihadis spun out of control outside and inside Pakistan. By shielding it from retaliation, the nuclear weapons also sealed it into its own dysfunction -- so much so that the Great South Asian War, fought on-and-off since 1947, was not so much won by India as lost by Pakistan.","[""History"",""Nonfiction"",""Pakistan"",""India"",""Politics""]",1/1/2017,2017.0,"{""name"":""Myra Macdonald"",""num_books"":7,""num_followers"":""7""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":3,""reviews_percentage"":2},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":5,""reviews_percentage"":3},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":34,""reviews_percentage"":25},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":58,""reviews_percentage"":42},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":36,""reviews_percentage"":26}}","""$14.39""",external,external_focus,True

On Evil is a compelling and at times disturbing tour of the many faces of evil. What is evil, and what makes people do awful things? If we can explain evil, do we explain it away? Can we imagine the mind of a serial killer, or does such evil defy description? Does evil depend on a contrast with good, as religion tells us, or can there be evil for evil's sake?
Adam Morton argues that any account of evil must help us understand three  why evil occurs; why evil often arises out of banal or everyday situations; and how we can be seen as evil. Drawing on fascinating examples as diverse as Augustine, Buffy the Vampire Slayer , psychological studies of deviant behaviour and profiles of serial killers, Adam Morton argues that evil occurs when internal, mental barriers against it simply break down. He also introduces us to some nightmare people, such as Adolf Eichmann and Hannibal Lecter, reminding us that understanding their actions as humans brings us closer to understanding evil.

When should blueberries ripen? And what should  a clever moose eat? Questions like these may seem simple or downright strange—yet they form the backbone of natural history, a discipline that fostered some of our most important scientific theories, from natural selection to glaciation. Through careful, patient observations of the organisms that live in an area, their distributions, and how they interact with other species, we gain a more complete picture of the world around us, and our place in it.

In What Should a Clever Moose Eat? , John Pastor explores the natural history of the North Woods, an immense and complex forest that stretches from the western shore of Lake Superior to the far coast of Newfoundland. The North Woods is one of the most ecologically and geologically interesting places on the planet, with a host of natural history questions arising from each spruce or sugar maple. From the geological history of the region to the shapes of leaves and the relationship between aspens, caterpillars, and predators, Pastor delves into a captivating range of topics as diverse as the North Woods themselves. Through his meticulous observations of the natural world, scientists and nonscientists alike learn to ask natural history questions and form their own theories, gaining a greater understanding of and love for the North Woods—and other natural places precious to them.

Revealing the order at the foundation of the seemingly chaotic natural world, Patterns in Nature explores not only the math and science but also the beauty and artistry behind nature’s awe-inspiring designs.

Unlike the patterns we create in technology, architecture, and art, natural patterns are formed spontaneously from the forces that act in the physical world. Very often the same types of pattern and form – spirals, stripes, branches, and fractals, say—recur in places that seem to have nothing in common, as when the markings of a zebra mimic the ripples in windblown sand. That’s because, as Patterns in Nature shows, at the most basic level these patterns can often be described using the same mathematical and physical  there is a surprising underlying unity in the kaleidoscope of the natural world. Richly illustrated with 250 color photographs and anchored by accessible and insightful chapters by esteemed science writer Philip Ball, Patterns in Nature reveals the organization at work in vast and ancient forests, powerful rivers, massing clouds, and coastlines carved out by the sea.

In Biblical Literacy, Telushkin turns his attention to the Hebrew Bible (also known as the Old Testament), the most influential series of books in human history. Along with the Ten Commandments, the Bible's most famous document, no piece of legislation ever enacted has influenced human behavior as much as the biblical injunction to ""Love your neighbor as yourself."" No political tract has motivated human beings in so many diverse societies to fight for political freedom as the Exodus story of God's liberation of the Israelite slaves--which shows that God intends that, ultimately, people be free.

The Bible's influence, however, has conveyed as much through its narratives as its laws. Its timeless and moving tales about the human condition and man's relationship to God have long shaped Jewish and Christian notions of morality, and continue to stir the conscience and imagination of believers and skeptics alike.

There is a universality in biblical stories:

The murder of Abel by his brother Cain is a profound tragedy of sibling jealousy and family love gone awry (see pages 11-14).

Abraham',s challenge to God to save the lives of the evil people of Sodom is a fierce drama of man in confrontation with God, suggesting the human right to contend with the Almighty when it is feared He is acting unjustly (see pages 32-34).

Jacob's, deception of his blind father, Isaac raises the timeless question: Do the ends justify the means when the fate of the world is at stake (see pages 46-55).

Encyclopedia in scope, but dynamic and original in its observations and organization, Biblical Literacy makes available in one volume the Bible's timeless stories of love, deceit, and the human condition; its most important laws and ideas; and an annotated listing of all 613 laws of the Torah for both layman and professional, there is no other reference work or interpretation of the Bible quite like this Stunning volume.","[""Judaism"",""Religion"",""Jewish"",""Judaica"",""Nonfiction"",""Reference"",""History"",""Theology"",""Spirituality"",""Faith""]",10/8/1997,1997.0,"{""name"":""Joseph Telushkin"",""num_books"":36,""num_followers"":""154""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":0,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":4,""reviews_percentage"":1},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":41,""reviews_percentage"":12},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":107,""reviews_percentage"":33},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":164,""reviews_percentage"":51}}","""$23.99""",external,external_focus,True

And this language is mathematics."" In The Language of Mathematics , award-winning author Keith Devlin reveals the vital role mathematics plays in our eternal quest to understand who we are and the world we live in. More than just the study of numbers, mathematics provides us with the eyes to recognize and describe the hidden patterns of life―patterns that exist in the physical, biological, and social worlds without, and the realm of ideas and thoughts within.

Taking the reader on a wondrous journey through the invisible universe that surrounds us―a universe made visible by mathematics―Devlin shows us what keeps a jumbo jet in the air, explains how we can see and hear a football game on TV, allows us to predict the weather, the behavior of the stock market, and the outcome of elections.

Now, a hundred years after her sinking, historian John Welshman reconstructs the fascinating individual experiences of twelve of the inhabitants of this tragically
short-lived floating village.

In Titanic , Welshman offers a minute-by-minute account of the doomed liner's last hours, based on a representative cross-section of those who sailed in  men and women, old and young, passengers and crew, wealthy and poor. He introduces the reader to a fascinating cast of twelve
eye-witnesses, including Arthur H. Rostron, Captain of the Carpathia , the first ship to reach the scene; Charles Lightoller, the Titanic 's Second Officer; Archibald Gracie, a wealthy American cotton plantation owner; Elin Hakkarainen, a young migrant from Finland, travelling Third Class; and Edith
Brown, a teenager from South Africa. The book also documents the experiences of an Assistant Wireless Operator, a Stewardess, an amateur military historian, a governess, a teacher, and a domestic servant. The survivor accounts allow Welshman to construct a graphic and compelling picture of events on
a day-to-day and hour-by-hour basis, providing vivid glimpses of the tragedy as seen from their respective vantage points. In addition, Welshman tells the story of where these twelve people were from and what happened to those who survived in the years afterwards. Finally, the author, a respected
social historian, offers many insights into nineteenth-century social class, migration, work, and the broader history of Northern Ireland.

Drawing on published autobiographical accounts, diaries, private papers, archival materials, and a wide array of other sources,  The Last Night of a Small Town offers a unique account of one of the most memorable disasters in modern history.","[""History"",""Nonfiction""]",1/13/2012,2012.0,"{""name"":""John Welshman"",""num_books"":12,""num_followers"":""1""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":2,""reviews_percentage"":2},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":7,""reviews_percentage"":9},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":35,""reviews_percentage"":45},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":22,""reviews_percentage"":28},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":11,""reviews_percentage"":14}}","""$11.99""",external,external_focus,True

Norris contributes much in the way of new information and vital insights to our understanding of how the bomb got built and how the decision was made to drop it on a large population center. Richard Rhodes, author of The Making of the Atomic Bomb , writes, “The brilliant engineer who commanded [the Manhattan Project] has never had his due. Groves finally emerges as the historic, tough, larger-than-life leader who made the atomic bomb happen and gave shape to the atomic age.” Groves’s hard work and numerous innovations during World War II also had a lasting imprint on the Cold War that followed. Procedures and practices developed during the Manhattan Project became the building blocks of the “national security state” and the “military-industrial complex.”
“I had always thought of General Leslie Groves as a fringe character in the story of the atomic bomb,” says Seymour Hersh, “a military martinet widely ridiculed by the nuclear physicists. Norris has rewritten the history of the most important event of World War II and in so doing has given us the best account yet of the military colossus that built America’s first nuclear bombs.”","[""Biography"",""History"",""Science"",""Nonfiction"",""World War II"",""Biography Memoir"",""American History"",""Military History""]",4/9/2002,2002.0,"{""name"":""Robert S.

He was convicted and sentenced to death in a trial that Amnesty International has denounced as failing to meet the minimum standards of judicial fairness.

In Have Black Lives Ever Mattered?, Mumia gives voice to the many people of color who have fallen to police bullets or racist abuse, and offers the post-Ferguson generation advice on how to address police abuse in the United States. This collection of his radio commentaries on the topic features an in-depth essay written especially for this book to examine the history of policing in America, with its origins in the white slave patrols of the antebellum South and an explicit mission to terrorize the country’s black population. Applying a personal, historical, and political lens, Mumia provides a righteously angry and calmly principled radical black perspective on how racist violence is tearing our country apart and what must be done to turn things around.

But some of these schools succeeded in providing nurturing educational environments in spite of the injustices of segregation. Vanessa Siddle Walker tells the story of one such school in rural North Carolina, the Caswell County Training School, which operated from 1934 to 1969. She focuses especially on the importance of dedicated teachers and the principal, who believed their jobs extended well beyond the classroom, and on the community's parents, who worked hard to support the school. According to Walker, the relationship between school and community was mutually dependent. Parents sacrificed financially to meet the school's needs, and teachers and administrators put in extra time for professional development, specialized student assistance, and home visits. The result was a school that placed the needs of African American students at the center of its mission, which was in turn shared by the community. Walker concludes that the experience of CCTS captures a segment of the history of African Americans in segregated schools that has been overlooked and that provides important context for the ongoing debate about how best to educate African American children.

Few movies have captured our imagination as deeply and enduringly as those of the 'Alien' quartet, which follow the odyssey of Sigourney Weaver's Flight Lieutenant Ellen Ripley. In this gripping and limpidly written book, Stephen Mulhall shows why these films fascinate us, by showing that they are compelling examples of philosophy in action. Bringing a philosopher's eye to cinema, he argues that the 'Alien' films take us deep into the question of what it is to be human. By developing the sexual significance of the aliens themselves and of Ripley's resistance to them, these films explore the relation of human identity to the body, in the context of a hyper-Darwinian universe which both sharpens and subverts the distinction between the natural and the technological, and which pits the hope of redemption against nihilism. The book also considers the nature of 'sequeldom· in contemporary cinema. What is the relation between each 'Alien· movie's distinctive plot and the overarching narrative of the 'Alien' universe? How does the work of each director who has contributed to the 'Alien· series relate to the themes of their other films, such as Ridley Scott's Bladerunner, James Cameron's Terminator and David Fincher's Se7en?

For the first time in generations, Indians are shaping their own destinies, largely beyond the control of whites, reinventing Indian education and justice, exploiting the principle of tribal sovereignty in ways that empower tribal governments far beyond most American's imaginations.

No pontificating. Just some uncommon sense about the things that have made this country great—and the culprits who are screwing it up. Bernard Goldberg takes dead aim at the America Bashers (the cultural elites who look down their snobby noses at ""ordinary"" Americans) . . . the Hollywood Blowhards (incredibly ditzy celebrities who think they're smart just because they're famous) . . . the TV Schlockmeisters (including the one whose show has been compared to a churning mass of maggots devouring rotten meat) . . . the Intellectual Thugs (bigwigs at some of our best colleges, whose views run the gamut from left wing to far left wing) . . . and many more. Goldberg names names, counting down the villains in his rogues' gallery from 100 all the way to 1—and, yes, you-know-who is number 37. Some supposedly ""serious"" journalists also made the list, including the journalist-diva who sold out her integrity and hosted one of the dumbest hours in the history of network television news. And there are those famous miscreants who have made America a nastier place than it ought to be—a far more selfish, vulgar, and cynical place. But Goldberg doesn't just round up the usual suspects we have come to know and detest. He also exposes some of the people who operate away from the limelight but still manage to pull a lot of strings and do all sorts of harm to our culture. Most of all, 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America is about a country where as long as anything goes, as one of the good guys in the book puts it, sooner or later everything will go. This is serious stuff for sure. But Goldberg will also make you laugh as he harpoons scoundrels like the congresswoman who thinks there aren't enough hurricanes named after black people, and the environmentalist to the stars who yells at total strangers driving SUVs—even though she tools around the country in a gas-guzzling private jet. With Bias , Bernard Goldberg took us behind the scenes and exposed the way Big Journalism distorts the news. Now he has written a book that goes even further. This time he casts his eye on American culture at large—and the result is a book that is sure to become the voice of all those Americans who feel that no one is speaking for them on perhaps the most vital issue of  the kind of country in which we want to live.","[""Politics"",""Nonfiction"",""History"",""Humor"",""Audiobook"",""Political Science"",""Cultural"",""Business""]",7/5/2005,2005.0,"{""name"":""Bernard Goldberg"",""num_books"":15,""num_followers"":""23""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":107,""reviews_percentage"":8},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":170,""reviews_percentage"":12},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":413,""reviews_percentage"":31},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":379,""reviews_percentage"":28},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":241,""reviews_percentage"":18}}","""$6.99""",external,external_focus,True

This was the parting shot, an opportunity to offer a personal and frank view of the host country, the manners and morals of its people, their institutions, the state of their cooking and their drains.

They operate family businesses. They work day and night striving for the American Dream. All three sons forge a bond with their controlling father, Frank Sr., and their soft-spoken favorite uncle, Nick. As a boy, the oldest son, Frank Jr., realizes that his father and uncle are also “made” members of another close-knit family: the outfit.     In Operation Family Secrets Frank Calabrese, Jr., tells the turbulent tale of a family dominated by a violent patriarch who breaks a longstanding unwritten outfit code and “brings the street into his home” by enlisting two of his sons into the outfit’s 26th Street/Chinatown crew. Frank Jr. reveals for the first time the outfit’s “made” ceremony and describes being put to work alongside his father and uncle in loan sharking, gambling, labor racketeering, and extortion, and plotting the slaying of a fellow gangster, while they commit the bombing murder of a trucking executive, the gangland execution of two mobsters whose burial in an Indiana cornfield was reenacted in Martin Scorsese’s blockbuster film Casino, and numerous other hits.     The Calabrese Crew’s colossal earnings and extreme ruthlessness make them both a dreaded criminal gang and the object of an intense FBi inquiry. Eventually Frank Jr., his father, and Uncle Nick are convicted on racketeering violations, and “Junior” and “Senior” are sent to the same federal penitentiary in Michigan. Upon arrival, Frank Jr. makes a life-changing decision: to go straight rather than agree to his father’s plans to resume crew activities after serving his sentence. But he needs to keep his father behind bars in order to regain control of his life and save his family. Frank Jr. makes a secret deal with prosecutors, and for six months—unmonitored and unprotected—he wears a wire as his father recounts decades of hideous crimes. Frank Jr.’s cooperation with the FBi for virtually no monetary gain or special privileges helps create the government’s “operation Family Secrets” campaign against the Chicago outfit. The case reopens eighteen unsolved murders and also implicates twelve La Cosa Nostra soldiers and two outfit bosses. it becomes one of the largest organized crime cases in U.S. history.     Operation Family Secrets intimately portrays how organized crime rots a family from the inside out while detailing Frank Jr.’s deadly prison-yard mission, the FBI’s landmark investigation, and the U.S. attorney’s office’s daring prosecution of america’s most dangerous criminal organization.","[""Nonfiction"",""True Crime"",""Crime"",""Memoir"",""Biography"",""History"",""Mystery"",""Autobiography"",""Biography Memoir"",""Historical""]",3/8/2011,2011.0,"{""name"":""Frank Calabrese Jr."",""num_books"":3,""num_followers"":""5""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":17,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":91,""reviews_percentage"":8},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":350,""reviews_percentage"":30},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":408,""reviews_percentage"":35},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":270,""reviews_percentage"":23}}","""$10.99""",external,internal_focus,True

But today the field of personality science has moved well beyond the nature vs. nurture debate. In Who Are You, Really? Dr. Brian Little presents a distinctive view of how personality shapes our lives—and why this matters. Little makes the case for a third nature to the human condition—the pursuit of personal projects, idealistic dreams, and creative ventures that shape both people’s lives and their personalities. Little uncovers what personality science has been discovering about the role of personal projects, revealing how this new concept can help people better understand themselves and shape their lives.  In this important work, Little argues that it is essential to devote energy and resources to creative endeavors in a highly focused fashion, even if it takes away from other components of our well-being. This does not mean that we cannot shift from one core project to another in the days of our lives. In fact, it is precisely that ability to flexibly craft projects that is the greatest source of sustainability. Like learning to walk, forcing ourselves out of balance as we step is the only way in which we can move forward. And it is the only way that human flourishing can be enhanced.  The well-lived life is based on the sustainable pursuit of core projects in our lives.

The answer is  cut out the ""soft addictions."" As Judith Wright reveals in this revised and expanded edition of her classic self-help book There Must Be More Than This , many of us are addicted to seemingly harmless and socially sanctioned habits such as shopping, watching TV, and gossiping-robbing us of our time, clouding our clarity of mind, and masking our deeper longing for lasting joy.

According to Wright, soft addictions are seductive because they satisfy powerful desires-and we easily become hooked because they are perceived as ""normal"" behavior, behavior that doesn't seem to demand the extraordinary measures of a drug or alcohol addiction. Yet soft addictions do call out for action and in this groundbreaking book, Judith Wright explains why they are so damaging and outlines an effective plan for overcoming these negative habits to discover more passion, love, commitment, and meaning in our lives.","[""Nonfiction"",""Productivity"",""Self Help""]",1/1/2006,2006.0,"{""name"":""Judith Wright"",""num_books"":29,""num_followers"":""17""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":4,""reviews_percentage"":5},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":15,""reviews_percentage"":19},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":21,""reviews_percentage"":26},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":19,""reviews_percentage"":24},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":19,""reviews_percentage"":24}}","""$11.99""",internal,external_focus,False

And of the book by Anne Delbee, the book that caused a sensation in France, inspired a motion picture, and resurrected the artist for a public that had forgotten her.
Camille Claudel's work possesses a unique power and visionary originality, marking her as one of the greatest sculptors of the nineteenth century. At a time when it was a scandal for a young woman to wish to be a sculptor, Camille threw all her innate enthusiasm and implacable will into just such quest. In 1883, she met Auguste Rodin, and the master accepted her as a student; soon he became her lover. After fifteen years of a passionate and stormy relationship and being beaten down by a system that strongly favored male artists, Camille emerged exhausted and vanquished. In 1913, protective of the career of her brother, the poet Paul Claudel, her family placed Camille in an asylum near Avignon, where she spent the final thirty years of her life.
In this fictionalized biography (illustrated by photographs of the artist's work and including many passages from her letters from the asylum), Anne Delbee probes, with sympathy and sensitivity, the heart and soul of Camille Claudel, restoring her to her rightful place as woman and artist.","[""Art"",""Nonfiction"",""Biography"",""France"",""Feminism"",""History"",""Womens"",""Art History"",""French Literature"",""Biography Memoir""]",1/1/1982,1982.0,"{""name"":""Anne Delbée"",""num_books"":11,""num_followers"":""10""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":10,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":55,""reviews_percentage"":6},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":164,""reviews_percentage"":18},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":339,""reviews_percentage"":39},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":298,""reviews_percentage"":34}}",,external,external_focus,True

We allocate trillions of dollars and make public policy and personal decisions based upon them, but what do they really tell us?

We are bombarded every day with numbers that tell us how we are doing, whether the economy is growing or shrinking, whether the future looks bright or dim. Gross national product, balance of trade, unemployment, inflation, and consumer confidence guide our actions, yet few of us know where these numbers come from, what they mean, or why they rule our world.

In The Leading Indicators , Zachary Karabell tells the fascinating history of these indicators. They were invented in the mid-twentieth century to address the urgent challenges of the Great Depression, World War II, and the Cold War. They were rough measures— designed to give clarity in a data-parched world that was made up of centralized, industrial nations—yet we still rely on them today.

We live in a world shaped by information technology and the borderless flow of capital and goods. When we follow a 1950s road map for a twenty-first-century world, we shouldn’t be surprised if we get lost.

What is urgently needed, Karabell makes clear, is not that we invent a new set of numbers but that we tap into the thriving data revolution, which offers unparalleled access to the information we need. Companies should not base their business plans on GDP projections; individuals should not decide whether to buy a home or get a degree based on the national unemployment rate. If you want to buy a home, look for a job, start a company, or run a business, you should find your own indicators. National housing figures don’t matter; local ones do. You can find them at the click of a button. Personal, made-to-order indicators will meet our needs today, and the revolution is well underway.

Early in the nineteenth century, American educators began to realize that if this great experiment in liberty was to be maintained, then an informed patriotism would have to be instilled in the young. The ideals that produced the nation needed to pass from one generation to the next; thus, these educators presented rising new citizens with a small handbook containing the essential elements of the American creed.

For thousands of years, artists, sages, philosophers, and theologians have connected the beautiful and the sacred and identified art with our longing for God. Now we live in a day when convenience and practicality have largely displaced beauty as a value. The church is no exception. Even salvation is commonly viewed in a scientific and mechanistic manner and presented as a plan, system, or formula.

In Beauty Will Save the World , Brian Zahnd presents the argument that this loss of beauty as a principal value has been disastrous for Western culture, and especially for the church. The full message of the beauty of the gospel has been replaced by our desires to satisfy our material needs, to empirically prove our faith, and to establish political power in our world--the exact same things that Christ was tempted with and rejected in the wilderness.
Zahnd shows that by following the teachings of the Beatitudes, the church can become a viable alternative to current-day political, commercial, and religious power and can actually achieve what these powers promise to provide but fail to deliver. Using stories from the lives of St. Francis of Assisi and from his own life, he teaches us to stay on the journey to discover the kingdom of God in a fuller, richer, more beautiful, way.

In 1944, 13-year-old Fritz was almost old enough to join the Hitler Youth in his German village of Kleinheubach. That same year in Tab, Hungary, 12-year-old Bernie was loaded onto a train with the rest of the village's Jewish inhabitants and taken to Auschwitz, where his whole family was murdered. How to bridge the deadly gulf that separated them in their youth, how not to allow the power of the past to separate them even now, as it separates many others, become the focus of their friendship, and together they begin the project of remembering.

The separate stories of their youth are told in one voice, at Bernat Rosner's request. He is able to retrace his journey into hell, slowly, over many sessions, describing for his friend the ""other life"" he has resolutely put away until now. Frederic Tubach, who must confront his own years in Nazi Germany as the story unfolds, becomes the narrator of their double memoir. Their decision to open their friendship to the past brings a poignancy to stories that are horrifyingly familiar. Adding a further and fascinating dimension is the counterpoint of their similar village childhoods before the Holocaust and their very different paths to personal rebirth and creative adulthood in America after the war.

Seldom has a memoir been so much about the present, as we see the authors proving what goodwill and intelligence can accomplish in the cause of reconciliation. This intimate story of two boys trapped in evil and destructive times, who become men with the freedom to construct their own future, has much to tell us about building bridges in our public as well as our personal lives.","[""Holocaust"",""World War II"",""Nonfiction"",""History"",""Biography"",""Memoir"",""Jewish""]",4/4/2001,2001.0,"{""name"":""Bernat Rosner"",""num_books"":4,""num_followers"":""1""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":0,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":2,""reviews_percentage"":1},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":30,""reviews_percentage"":22},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":44,""reviews_percentage"":32},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":58,""reviews_percentage"":43}}","""$20.99""",external,external_focus,True

Following a simple Edinburgh girlhood, Grace Dalrymple came of age in the sin city of London, where wealthy men ruled society and women had everything to lose, starting with their reputations.  As an impressionable bride of seventeen who married a man more than twice her age, Grace's remarkable beauty (likened by journalists to ""a May morning"") soon attracted the attentions of other men.  A disastrous liaison with a consummate rake not only branded Grace as a demi-rep - a woman with half a reputation - but the scandal provoked Dr. John Eliot, her philandering husband, to pursue a divorce.

Grace became mistress of the most infamous peer in England, George James, Lord Cholmondeley, whose ""secret perfections"" were reputed to inspire ""female enthusiasm.""  Cholmondeley commemorated the relationship by commissioning two works from eminent portraitist Thomas Gainsborough, first in 1778 and later in 1782, the same year Grace gave birth to a daughter, Georgiana (who may, in fact, have been the child of the Prince of Wales).  Had Grace been an aristocrat, she and Cholmondeley might have had a future together, but it was not to be.

The tabloids broke the news: ""Miss Dalrymple has embarked for France, and it is said parted with her noble gallant.""  Grace was soon to find a new protector in that nation's richest man, Philippe, Duc d'Orleans.  Though Grace was ensconced as ""one of the most brilliant and popular among the fashionable 'impures,'"" her liaison with the duke turned perilous when Orleans fell to the Revolution's guillotine, just as she narrowly escaped with her life.

""People die, but love may not,"" declares author Jo Manning of her subject's romantic and historic misadventures.  A connoisseur of the times, Manning ably demonstrates - through contemporary newspapers, magazines, prints, and portraits as well as Grace's posthumously published journal - how life in George III's England and Marie Antoinette's France can seem strangely familiar, especially when history turns to affairs of the heart.","[""Biography"",""History"",""Nonfiction"",""18th Century"",""French Revolution"",""Research""]",1/1/2005,2005.0,"{""name"":""Jo Manning"",""num_books"":10,""num_followers"":""3""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":15,""reviews_percentage"":8},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":24,""reviews_percentage"":14},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":46,""reviews_percentage"":27},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":58,""reviews_percentage"":34},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":27,""reviews_percentage"":15}}",,external,external_focus,True

William Tyndale left England in 1524 to translate the word of God into English. This was heresy, punishable by death. Sir Thomas More, hailed as a saint and a man for all seasons, considered it his divine duty to pursue Tyndale. He did so with an obsessive ferocity that, in all probability, led to Tyndale's capture and death.

The words that Tyndale wrote during his desperate exile have a beauty and familiarity that still resonate across the English-speaking world: ""Death, where is thy sting?...eat, drink, and be merry...our Father which art in heaven.""

His New Testament, which he translated, edited, financed, printed, and smuggled into England in 1526, passed with few changes into subsequent versions of the Bible. So did those books of the Old Testament that he lived to finish.

Brian Moynahan's lucid and meticulously researched biography illuminates Tyndale's life, from his childhood in England, to his death outside Brussels. It chronicles the birth pangs of the Reformation, the wrath of Henry VIII, the sympathy of Anne Boleyn, and the consuming malice of Thomas More. Above all, it reveals the English Bible as a labor of love, for which a man in an age more spiritual than our own willingly gave his life.","[""History"",""Biography"",""Religion"",""Nonfiction"",""Christian"",""Christianity"",""Tudor Period"",""Faith"",""World History"",""Theology""]",8/23/2003,2003.0,"{""name"":""Brian Moynahan"",""num_books"":44,""num_followers"":""18""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":3,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":5,""reviews_percentage"":2},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":29,""reviews_percentage"":13},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":82,""reviews_percentage"":39},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":89,""reviews_percentage"":42}}","""$11.99""",external,external_focus,True

A fresh look at the life of Mozart during his imperial years by one of the world's leading Mozart scholars. ""I now stand at the gateway to my fortune,"" Mozart wrote in a letter of 1790. He had entered into the service of Emperor Joseph II of Austria two years earlier as Imperial-Royal Chamber Composer―a salaried appointment with a distinguished title and few obligations. His extraordinary subsequent output, beginning with the three final great symphonies from the summer of 1788, invites a reassessment of this entire period of his life. Readers will gain a new appreciation and understanding of the composer's works from that time without the usual emphasis on his imminent death. The author discusses the major biographical and musical implications of the royal appointment and explores Mozart's ""imperial style"" on the basis of his major compositions―keyboard,chamber, orchestral, operatic, and sacred―and focuses on the large, unfamiliar works he left incomplete.

Such was the life of many young women of the age: they had no independent status under the law and were entirely a part of their husband’s property once married.  

Marie and Hortense, however, had other ambitions in mind altogether. Miserable in their marriages and determined to live independently, they abandoned their husbands in secret and began lives of extraordinary daring on the run and in the public eye. The beguiling sisters quickly won the affections of noblemen and kings alike. Their flight became popular fodder for salon conversation and tabloids, and was closely followed by seventeenth-century European society. The Countess of Grignan remarked that they were traveling “like two heroines out of a novel.” Others gossiped that they “were roaming the countryside in pursuit of wandering lovers.”  Their scandalous behavior—disguising themselves as men, gambling, and publicly disputing with their husbands—served as more than just entertainment. It sparked discussions across Europe concerning the legal rights of husbands over their wives.Elizabeth Goldsmith’s vibrant biography of the Mancini sisters—drawn from personal papers of the players involved and the tabloids of the time—illuminates the lives of two pioneering free spirits who were feminists long before the word existed. ","[""History"",""Nonfiction"",""Biography"",""France"",""17th Century"",""Italy"",""Historical"",""European History"",""Womens Studies"",""Biography Memoir""]",4/1/2012,2012.0,"{""name"":""Elizabeth C.

""Not since The Latham Diaries came out in 2005 has a book delivered so many scoops, insights and revelations into how power is wielded in Australia ... a treasure trove of gems"" - Crikey

""Pamela Williams has written a manual for corporate directors and senior managers, who should all be compelled to read it."" - Mark Westfield, The Australian

An incisive, hard-hitting and utterly compelling expose of media, powerful mates and multimillion-dollar deals, Killing Fairfax tells the inside story of the decline of hallowed media company Fairfax, publisher of The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and The Australian Financial Review.

Covering a decade and a half of lost opportunity and mismanagement, this story culminates in Fairfax's catastrophic loss of the classified advertising market to the internet, as the famous 'rivers of gold' run dry. The savage twist in the tale is that the new companies dominating the online advertising market were not just hungry internet start-ups - but one by one, each of the new leaders in the field came under the direct influence of two traditional media tycoons, James Packer and Lachlan Murdoch, both intent on expanding their own online businesses. With exclusive and unprecedented access to both Murdoch and Packer, as well as an extraordinary line-up of Australian business leaders and influential powerbrokers, this is a powerful insiders' story of the deals, the power plays and the machinations behind the influential media organisation's decline.

A riveting, never-before-told tale of Shakespearean dimensions, Killing Faifax is an unputdownable account of corporate ambition and arrogance; fathers and sons; old media and new media; and brutal business dealings. Killing Fairfax is destined for the top of the bestseller list given Australians' fascination with the media and powerful media families. Pamela Williams' impeccable research, revelatory writing style and ability to get key players to speak openly and on the record makes this a book with a broad readership. It is the ultimate Father's Day gift but, more importantly, it adds to our knowledge of an important chapter in our country's newspaper history.

As Sean McMeekin reveals in this startling reinterpretation of the war, it was neither the British nor the French but rather a small clique of Germans and Turks who thrust the Islamic world into the conflict for their own political, economic, and military ends.

""The Berlin-Baghdad Express"" tells the fascinating story of how Germany exploited Ottoman pan-Islamism in order to destroy the British Empire, then the largest Islamic power in the world. Meanwhile the Young Turks harnessed themselves to German military might to avenge Turkey s hereditary enemy, Russia. Told from the perspective of the key decision-makers on the Turco-German side, many of the most consequential events of World War I Turkey s entry into the war, Gallipoli, the Armenian massacres, the Arab revolt, and the Russian Revolution are illuminated as never before.

Drawing on a wealth of new sources, McMeekin forces us to re-examine Western interference in the Middle East and its lamentable results. It is an epic tragicomedy of unintended consequences, as Turkish nationalists give Russia the war it desperately wants, jihad begets an Islamic insurrection in Mecca, German sabotage plots upend the Tsar delivering Turkey from Russia s yoke, and German Zionism midwifes the Balfour Declaration. All along, the story is interwoven with the drama surrounding German efforts to complete the Berlin to Baghdad railway, the weapon designed to win the war and assure German hegemony over the Middle East.","[""History"",""Nonfiction"",""Germany"",""World War I"",""World History"",""European History"",""War"",""Islam"",""Politics"",""Historical""]",6/1/2010,2010.0,"{""name"":""Sean McMeekin"",""num_books"":16,""num_followers"":""138""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":6,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":26,""reviews_percentage"":5},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":110,""reviews_percentage"":23},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":198,""reviews_percentage"":42},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":130,""reviews_percentage"":27}}","""$20.49""",external,external_focus,True

In 1929, the Soviet government set aside a sparsely populated area in the Soviet Far East for settlement by Jews. The place was called Birobidzhan.The idea of an autonomous Jewish region was championed by Jewish Communists, Yiddishists, and intellectuals, who envisioned a haven of post-oppression Jewish culture. By the mid-1930s tens of thousands of Soviet Jews, as well as about a thousand Jews from abroad, had moved there. The state-building ended quickly, in the late 1930s, with arrests and purges instigated by Stalin. But after the Second World War, Birobidzhan received another influx of Jews--those who had been dispossessed by the war. In the late 1940s a second wave of arrests and imprisonments swept through the area, traumatizing Birobidzhan's Jews into silence and effectively shutting down most of the Jewish cultural enterprises that had been created. Where the Jews Aren't is a haunting account of the dream of Birobidzhan--and how it became the cracked and crooked mirror in which we can see the true story of the Jews in twentieth-century Russia.

In this compelling biography, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Michael D’Antonio gives us the real-life rags-to-riches story of Milton S. Hershey, a largely uneducated businessman whose idealistic sense of purpose created an immense financial empire, a town, and a legacy that lasts to this day. Hershey, the son of a minister’s daughter and an irresponsible father who deserted the family, began his career inauspiciously when the two candy shops he opened both went bankrupt. Undeterred, he started the Lancaster Caramel Company, which brought him success at last. Eventually he sold his caramel operation and went on to perfect the production process of chocolate to create a stable, consistent bar with a long shelf life...and an American icon was born. Hershey was more than a successful businessman—he was a progressive thinker who believed in capitalism as a means to higher goals. He built the world’s largest chocolate factory and a utopian village for his workers on a large tract of land in rural Pennsylvania, and used his own fortune to keep his workers employed during the Great Depression. In addition, he secretly willed his fortune to a boys’ school and orphanage, both of which now control a vast endowment.","[""Biography"",""Nonfiction"",""History"",""Business"",""Food"",""American History"",""Historical"",""Audiobook"",""Biography Memoir"",""Leadership""]",1/1/2006,2006.0,"{""name"":""Michael D'Antonio"",""num_books"":47,""num_followers"":""88""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":13,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":55,""reviews_percentage"":5},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":259,""reviews_percentage"":25},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":484,""reviews_percentage"":47},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":212,""reviews_percentage"":20}}","""$11.39""",external,external_focus,True

From a haphazard beginning in 449 AD, when a legendary, fearsome Germanic warrior named Hengest tripped and fell onto British shores, the real story of English has been rife with accident, physical comedy, phallic  monuments, rude behaviour, dubious facts, and an alarming quantity of poetry written by lawyers.

Across vast distances of space and time, from the language’s origins to its fast-approaching retirement, a moody and miraculously long-lived Hengest voyages to the pubs of Chaucer’s London, aboard pirate ships in the north Atlantic, to plantations in Barbados, bookstores in Jamaica, the chilly inlet of Quidi Vidi, Newfoundland, a private men’s club in Australia, and beyond.

Part Monty Python sketch, part Oxford English Dictionary, The Rude Story of English displays an exuberant love of language and a sharp, anti-authoritarian sense of humour.

Wealthy, powerful, and potentially dangerous, hedge fund moguls have become the It Boys of twenty-first ­century capitalism. Ken Griffin of Citadel started out trading convertible bonds from his dorm room at Harvard. Julian Robertson staffed his hedge fund with college athletes half his age, then he flew them to various retreats in the Rockies and raced them up the mountains. Paul Tudor Jones posed for a magazine photograph next to a killer shark and happily declared that a 1929-style crash would be ""total rock-and-roll"" for him. Michael Steinhardt was capable of reducing underlings to sobs. ""All I want to do is kill myself,"" one said. ""Can I watch?"" Steinhardt responded. 

Finance professors have long argued that beating the market is impossible, and yet drawing on insights from physics, economics, and psychology, these titans have cracked the market's mysteries and gone on to earn fortunes. Their innovation has transformed the world, spawning new markets in exotic financial instruments and rewriting the rules of capitalism. 

More than just a history, More Money Than God is a window on tomorrow's financial system. Hedge funds have been left for dead after past financial panics: After the stock market rout of the early 1970s, after the bond market bloodbath of 1994, after the collapse of Long Term Capital Management in 1998, and yet again after the dot-com crash in 2000. Each time, hedge funds have proved to be survivors, and it would be wrong to bet against them now. Banks such as CitiGroup, brokers such as Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, home lenders such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, insurers such as AIG, and money market funds run by giants such as Fidelity-all have failed or been bailed out. But the hedge fund industry has survived the test of 2008 far better than its rivals.

This collection of quotes demonstrates the elegant simplicity of Ai Weiwei's thoughts on key aspects of his art, politics, and life. A master at communicating powerful ideas in astonishingly few words, Ai Weiwei is known for his innovative use of social media to disseminate his views. The short quotations presented here have been carefully selected from articles, tweets, and interviews given by this acclaimed Chinese artist and activist. The book is organized into six categories: freedom of expression; art and activism; government, power, and moral choices; the digital world; history, the historical moment, and the future; and personal reflections.

Together, these quotes span some of the most revealing moments of Ai Weiwei's eventful career--from his risky investigation into student deaths in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake to his arbitrary arrest in 2011--providing a window into the mind of one of the world's most electrifying and courageous contemporary artists.

Select Quotes from the Book:

On Freedom of Expression
Say what you need to say plainly, and then take responsibility for it.
A small act is worth a million thoughts.
Liberty is about our rights to question everything.
On Art and Activism


Everything is art. Everything is politics.
The art always wins. Anything can happen to me, but the art will stay.
Life is art. Art is life. I never separate it. I don't feel that much anger. I equally have a lot of joy.
On Government, Power, and Making Moral Choice


Once you've tasted freedom, it stays in your heart and no one can take it. Then, you can be more powerful than a whole country.
I feel powerless all the time, but I regain my energy by making a very small difference that won't cost me much.
Tips on surviving the regime: Respect yourself and speak for others. Do one small thing every day to prove the existence of justice.
On the Digital World


Only with the Internet can a peasant I have never met hear my voice and I can learn what's on his mind. A fairy tale has come true.
The Internet is uncontrollable. And if the Internet is uncontrollable, freedom will win. It's as simple as that.
The Internet is the best thing that could have happened to China.
On History, the Historical Moment, and the Future


If a nation cannot face its past, it has no future.
We need to get out of the old language.
The world is a sphere, there is no East or West.
Personal Reflection


I've never planned any part of my career--except being an artist. And I was pushed into that corner because I thought being an artist was the only way to have a little freedom.
Anyone fighting for freedom does not want to totally lose their freedom.
Expressing oneself is like a drug.

Not content with holding a bulging share of the market for software applications, nor with dominating the crucial operating systems business by virtue of its DOS and Windows programs, Microsoft is always looking to the future. And the future for Microsoft now goes by the name of Windows NT. A software innovation of the first order, NT could redefine the standards for computing throughout the world, into the next century. NT endows inexpensive personal computers with the capabilities of giant mainframes -- yet without sacrificing the inherent flexibility and appeal of PCs. Showstopper! is the inside story of this stunning breakthrough in computer technology. Stripping away myth after myth, this unprecedented tale lays bare the messy, wrenching reality of winning innovations. To date, America has dominated the global software industry through creating cutting-edge code and by depending on both the ingenuity of a few visionaries and the coordination of huge, costly teams of programmers and testers. Gates -- a managerial genius as well as a technical visionary -- promotes an atmosphere of controlled chaos at Microsoft, and the story of Windows NT perfectly reflects this ethos. The brain-child of David Cutler, a legendary programmer recruited by Gates in 1988, NT took five years and $150 million to complete. For much of that time, the massive program demanded the obsessive attention of more than 200 testers, writers and technicians. Focusing on Cutler's mercurial ability to inspire and lash his team, Showstopper! brilliantly portrays the human drama of this mammoth undertaking exposing the pressures, disappointments and ultimate triumph that emerge from a cauldron of constant deadlines, competition with peers and a perpetual war against the inevitable and ubiquitous bugs in the program -- among them the potentially lethal ""showstopper.""

Across the Atlantic and across political boundaries—anarchists to liberals, feminists and non-feminists—female pioneers shared a sense that social change was possible, and acted upon that belief. Dreamers of a New Day explores a period, from the belle époque to the roaring twenties, when women overturned social norms and assumptions as they struggled to define themselves as individuals. Forming broad coalitions and movements, they transformed the conditions of their own lives, decades before the intellectuals of the 1960s conceptualized “everyday life” as an arena for radical activity.

Drawing on a wealth of original research, Sheila Rowbotham has written a groundbreaking new history examining how women came to be modern. Challenging existing conceptions of citizenship and culture, from ethical living to consumerism, sexuality to democracy, these dreamers shaped many of the issues that remain at the forefront of twenty-first-century life.","[""Feminism"",""History"",""Nonfiction"",""Politics"",""Womens"",""Biography"",""Cultural"",""The United States Of America"",""Gender""]",6/15/2010,2010.0,"{""name"":""Sheila Rowbotham"",""num_books"":56,""num_followers"":""76""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":0,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":2,""reviews_percentage"":2},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":22,""reviews_percentage"":26},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":40,""reviews_percentage"":48},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":19,""reviews_percentage"":22}}","""$7.99""",external,external_focus,True

Today, such a confident assertion is far from self-evident. Democracy, in crisis across the West, must prove itself. In the West today, the authors argue, we no longer live in ""industrial democracies,"" but ""consumer democracies"" in which the governing ethos has ended up drowning households and governments in debt and resulted in paralyzing partisanship. In contrast, the long-term focus of the decisive and unified leadership of China is boldly moving its nation into the future. But China also faces challenges arising from its meteoric rise. Its burgeoning middle class will increasingly demand more participation, accountability of government, curbing corruption and the rule of law. As the 21st Century unfolds, both of these core systems of the global order must contend with the same reality: a genuinely multi-polar world where no single power dominates and in which societies themselves are becoming increasingly diverse. The authors argue that a new system of ""intelligent governance"" is required to meet these new challenges. To cope, the authors argue that both East and West can benefit by adapting each other’s best practices. Examining this in relation to widely varying political and cultural contexts, the authors quip that while China must lighten up, the US must tighten up. This highly timely volume is both a conceptual and practical guide of impressive scope to the challenges of good governance as the world continues to undergo profound transformation in the coming decades.","[""Politics"",""Nonfiction""]",3/11/2011,2011.0,"{""name"":""Nicolas Berggruen"",""num_books"":4,""num_followers"":""3""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":7,""reviews_percentage"":10},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":8,""reviews_percentage"":12},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":24,""reviews_percentage"":36},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":25,""reviews_percentage"":38}}","""$10.00""",external,internal_focus,True

In Homeric Moments, she brilliantly conveys the unique delights of Homer's epics as she focuses on the crucial scenes, or moments, that mark the high points of the narratives: Penelope and Odysseus, faithful wife and returning husband, sit face to face at their own hearth for the first time in twenty years; young Telemachus, with his father Odysseus at his side, boldly confronts the angry suitors; Achilles gives way to boundless grief at the death of his friend Patroclus.

Eva Brann demonstrates a way of reading Homer's poems that yields up their hidden treasures. With an alert eye for Homer's extraordinary visual effects and a keen ear for the musicality of his language, she helps the reader see the flickering campfires of the Greeks and hear the roar of the surf and the singing of nymphs. In Homeric Moments, Brann takes readers beneath the captivating surface of the poems to explore the inner connections and layers of meaning that have made the epics ""the marvel of the ages.""

""Written with wit and clarity, this book will be of value to those reading the Odyssey and the Iliad for the first time and to those teaching it to beginners.""—Library Journal

With Brann, old friends of Homer and new acquaintances alike will rejoice in the beauty, and above all the humanity, of the epics."" —Jacob Howland, University of Tulsa, Author of The Paradox of Political Philosophy

""In Homeric Moments, Eva Brann lovingly leads us, as she has surely led countless students, through the gallery of delights that is Homer's poetry. Brann's enthusiasm is as infectious as her deep familiarity with the works is illuminating.""—Rachel Hadas

""Brann invites us to enter a conversation [about Homer] in which information and formal arguments jostle with appreciations and frank conjectures and surmises to increase our pleasure and deepen the inward dimension of our humanity.""—Richard Freis, Millsaps College

""For anyone eager to experience the profundity and charm of Homer's great epic poems, Eva Brann's book will serve as a passionate and engaging guide. Brann displays a deep sensitivity to the cadence and flow of Homeric poetry, and the kind of knowing intimacy with its characters that comes from years of teaching and contemplation. Her relaxed but informative approach succeeds in conveying the grandeur of the great Homeric heroes, while making them continually resonate for our own lives. Brann helps us see that this poetry has an urgency for our own era as much as it did for a distant past.""—Ralph M. Rosen, University of Pennsylvania, Author of Old Comedy and The Iambographic Tradition

""The most enjoyable books about Homer are always written by those who have read and taught him the most. Eva Brann's collection of astute observations, unusual asides, and visual snapshots of the Iliad and the Odyssey reveals a lifelong friendship with the poet, and is as pleasurable as it is informative. Homeric Moments is rare erudition without pedantry, in a tone marked by good sense without levity.""—Victor Davis Hanson, author of The Other Greeks and co-author of Who Killed Homer?

Eva Brann is a member of the senior faculty at St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland, where she has taught for fifty years. She is a recipient of the National Humanities Medal.

For many thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans, Michigan's native peoples, the Anishnabeg, thrived in the forests and along the shores of the Great Lakes. Theirs were cultures in delicate social balance and in economic harmony with the natural order. Rites of Conquest details the struggles of Michigan Indians—the Ojibwa, Ottawa, and Potawatomi, and their neighbors—to maintain unique traditions in the wake of contact with Euro-Americans. The French quest for furs, the colonial aggression of the British, and the invasion of native homelands by American settlers is the backdrop for this fascinating saga of their resistance and accommodation to the new social order. Minavavana's victory at Fort Michilimackinac, Pontiac's attempts to expel the British, Pokagon's struggle to maintain a Michigan homeland, and Big Abe Le Blanc's fight for fishing rights are a few of the many episodes recounted in the pages of this book.

Beyond wars and warriors, Rites of Conquest is also about diplomacy and negotiation, mythology and magic, birth and death, and the joys and trials of daily life in the native villages of the Great Lakes region. Today, Michigan's Indian citizens struggle to solve problems that are a legacy of their past, while they attempt to maintain a distinctive place within modern society. In facing this challenge they often turn to the values and traditions that set them apart as the most enduring peoples of the Great Lakes region.

The mind-body problem cannot be confined to the relation between animal minds and animal bodies. If materialism cannot accommodate consciousness and other mind-related aspects of reality, then we must abandon a purely materialist understanding of nature in general, extending to biology, evolutionary theory, and cosmology. Since minds are features of biological systems that have developed through evolution, the standard materialist version of evolutionary biology is fundamentally incomplete. And the cosmological history that led to the origin of life and the coming into existence of the conditions for evolution cannot be a merely materialist history. An adequate conception of nature would have to explain the appearance in the universe of materially irreducible conscious minds, as such. No such explanation is available, and the physical sciences, including molecular biology, cannot be expected to provide one. The book explores these problems through a general treatment of the obstacles to reductionism, with more specific application to the phenomena of consciousness, cognition, and value.

It’s a story about the heroism of two men in battle at sea during World War II, and one woman fleeing Nazi Norway with her child. It’s about how courage can change the course of history.
AT ALL  How a Crippled Ship and Two American Merchant Marines Turned the Tide of World War II is the astonishing untold account, with original historical reporting, of how two men faced unfathomable danger to help save the island of Malta, Churchill’s crux of the war.
In 1942, the tiny island of Malta was the most heavily bombed place on earth. Hitler needed Malta as a stepping-stone to get to the oil in Iraq and Iran (Persia at the time). Blockaded by sea, Malta was running on empty, in food, fuel and ammunition. Axis U-boats and dive-bombers made supply convoys to Malta more like suicide missions. In this last-hope convoy, 50 warships escorted 13 freighters carrying aviation fuel, and a single critical tanker, the SS Ohio , with 107,000 barrels of oil from Texas. Winston Churchill had traveled to Washington and asked FDR for the tanker–his prime ministership was at stake over this mission to Malta.
Relentlessly dive-bombed and repeatedly torpedoed, the Ohio suffered huge hits and was abandoned. Two young American merchant mariners–pulled from the sea after their own ship went down in flames–boarded the ravaged tanker, repaired her guns and fought off German and Italian dive-bombers, as the sinking Ohio was towed at 4 knots toward Malta with a tiny crew of volunteers.
Sam Moses’ AT ALL COSTS is a triumphant story of human  fearless, selfless acts by men determined to save a ship and win a war; profound communal courage from an island under brutal siege; and leaders who understood the cause of freedom.

Kirkus (starred review)
A historical footnote provides a riveting tale of true American grit during World War II.
In 1942, the island of Malta was the primary launching point in the Mediterranean for Allied
aircraft and submarine attacks against Axis supply convoys. At the height of the North African
campaign, Rommel’s tanks prepared to sweep into Egypt, Iran and Iraq. The only thing they lacked was
the fuel to get there, and the shortage was equally desperate on Malta. The Allies launched Operation
Pedestal, a last-ditch effort to re-supply the base by sending a convoy from Britain through the Gibraltar
Strait to the beleaguered island. The convoy, which included the American tanker Ohio and the U.S.
freighter Santa Elisa , was anything but a milk run. Vietnam vet Moses ( Fast Guys, Rich Guys and
Idiots , not reviewed) crafts a thrilling adventure on the high seas, though it takes a while to get started.
The book’s first third juxtaposes Malta’s plight against the stories of two American merchant seamen
on the Santa Elisa : Lonnie Dales and Fred Larsen, through whose eyes the battle will be viewed in bluecollar
detail. Once Operation Pedestal begins, the narrative is all action. The convoy comes under
repeated attack, lives are lost, the Santa Elisa is sunk. Dales and Larsen find themselves aboard the
wounded Ohio , full to the brim with Texas crude. If they can hold off Nazi attacks and keep their new
ship afloat long enough to reach Malta, the operation will be a success. Moses takes readers directly
into the heat of battle, demonstrating a strong command of historical detail.
Highly recommended for fans of naval adventure. ( Peter Riva/International Transactions, Inc.)

"" At All Costs is an extraordinary work of research and an exciting read that pays tribute to a crucial enterprise taken against incredible odds. Sam Moses has brought the ghastliness of war and the beauty of heroism together, in jarring union."" –Frank Deford

“This book tells a great story. But Sam Moses is not just sharing a gripping tale. He is sharing an important and oft neglected story about a battle that played a decisive role in shaping the outcome of WW II. You will meet people who will linger in memory for their bravery, foolishness, or wisdom.” –Ken Auletta, author of Backstory

“Thrillingly told and beautifully researched, At All Costs is not just the against-all-odds story of the saving of Malta, but also of how the fate of nations can turn on the personal bravery of two ordinary men.”
–Robert Kurson, author of Shadow Divers

Ihmisen ajattelu koostuu karkeasti kahdesta päätyypistä: tietoisesta päättelystä ja intuitiosta. Intuitio on usein ylenkatsottu tietämisen tapa, joka jää helposti hyödyntämättä niin työelämässä, koulutuksessa kuin henkilökohtaisten tärkeiden ratkaisujen hetkillä. Älykäs intuitio käsittelee yleistajuisesti ja inspiroivasti intuitiivisen tiedon eri muotoja. Intuitio ei ole vain sattumanvarainen oivallus: intuitiivisen tiedon vastaanottamiseen voi tietoisesti virittäytyä. Intuition luotettavuutta on mahdollista arvioida ja intuitiivisia taitoja voi jokainen kehittää – oleellista on erottelukyvyn ja havainnointikyvyn kehittäminen. Yhdessä ne muodostavat intuition tunnistamisen ja kehittämisen ytimen. Teoksessa pohditaan intuitiota monen eri näkökulman kautta. Eri alojen asiantuntijat, ihan tavalliset ihmiset ja myös kirjoittaja itse kertovat, kuinka he hyödyntävät intuitiota elämässään.

For generations the Burdens were one of the wealthiest families in New York, thanks to the inherited fortune of Cornelius ""The Commodore"" Vanderbilt. By 1955, the year of Wendy's birth, the Burden's had become a clan of overfunded, quirky and brainy, steadfastly chauvinistic, and ultimately doomed bluebloods on the verge of financial and moral decline-and were rarely seen not holding a drink. In Dead End Gene Pool, Wendy invites readers to meet her tragically flawed family, including an uncle with a fondness for Hitler, a grandfather who believes you can never have enough household staff, and a remarkably flatulent grandmother.  At the heart of the story is Wendy's glamorous and aloof mother who, after her husband's suicide, travels the world in search of the perfect sea and ski tan, leaving her three children in the care of a chain- smoking Scottish nanny, Fifth Avenue grandparents, and an assorted cast of long-suffering household servants (who Wendy and her brothers love to terrorize).

Playbooks are how teams work and why they win. This book is about a different kind of  the one coaches, teams, universities, police, communities, the media, and fans seem to follow whenever a college football player is accused of sexual assault. It's a deep dive into how different institutions--the NCAA, athletic departments, universities, the media--run the same plays over and over again when these stories break. If everyone runs his play well, scrutiny dies down quickly, no institution ever has to change how it operates, and the evaporation of these cases into nothingness looks natural. In short, this playbook is why nothing ever changes. Unsportsmanlike Conduct unpacks this societal playbook piece by piece, and not only advocates that we destroy the old plays, but also suggests we replace them with ones that will force us to finally do something about this issue.

Those who worry about personal privacy and identity--especially in this day of technologies that encroach upon these rights--still use Orwell's ""Big Brother"" language to discuss privacy issues. But the reality is that the age of a monolithic Big Brother is over. And yet the threats are perhaps even more likely to destroy the rights we've assumed were ours. Database  The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century shows how, in these early years of the 21st century, advances in technology endanger our privacy in ways never before imagined. Direct marketers and retailers track our every purchase; surveillance cameras observe our movements; mobile phones will soon report our location to those who want to track us; government eavesdroppers listen in on private communications; misused medical records turn our bodies and our histories against us; and linked databases assemble detailed consumer profiles used to predict and influence our behavior. Privacy--the most basic of our civil rights--is in grave peril. Simson Garfinkel--journalist, entrepreneur, and international authority on computer security--has devoted his career to testing new technologies and warning about their implications. This newly revised update of the popular hardcover edition of Database Nation is his compelling account of how invasive technologies will affect our lives in the coming years. It's a timely, far-reaching, entertaining, and thought-provoking look at the serious threats to privacy facing us today. The book poses a disturbing  how can we protect our basic rights to privacy, identity, and autonomy when technology is making invasion and control easier than ever before? Garfinkel's captivating blend of journalism, storytelling, and futurism is a call to arms. It will frighten, entertain, and ultimately convince us that we must take action now to protect our privacy and identity before it's too late.","[""Nonfiction"",""Business"",""Technology"",""Internet"",""Computers""]",1/1/2000,2000.0,"{""name"":""Simson Garfinkel"",""num_books"":27,""num_followers"":""5""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":0,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":8,""reviews_percentage"":5},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":43,""reviews_percentage"":31},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":62,""reviews_percentage"":45},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":24,""reviews_percentage"":17}}","""$13.99""",external,external_focus,True

Paul Kengor's God and Ronald Reagan made presidential historian Paul Kengor's name as one of the premier chroniclers of the life and career of the 40th president. Now, with The Crusader, Kengor returns with the one book about Reagan that has not been written: The story of his lifelong crusade against communism, and of his dogged–and ultimately triumphant–effort to overthrow the Soviet Union.

Drawing upon reams of newly declassified presidential papers, as well as untapped Soviet media archives and new interviews with key players, Kengor traces Reagan's efforts to target the Soviet Union from his days as governor of California to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of what he famously dubbed the ""Evil Empire."" The result is a major revision and enhancement of what historians are only beginning to realize: That Reagan not only wished for the collapse of communism, but had a deep and specific understanding of what it would take––and effected dozens of policy shifts that brought the USSR to its heels within a decade of his presidency.

The Crusader makes use of key sources from behind the Iron Curtain, including one key memo that implicates a major American liberal politician–still in office today–in a scheme to enlist Soviet premier Yuri Andropov to help defeat Reagan's 1984 reelection bid. Such new finds make The Crusader not just a work of extraordinary history, but a work of explosive revelation that will be debated as hotly in 2006 as Reagan's policies were in the 1980s.","[""Biography"",""History"",""Politics"",""Presidents"",""Nonfiction"",""American History""]",1/1/2006,2006.0,"{""name"":""Paul Kengor"",""num_books"":28,""num_followers"":""119""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":4,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":8,""reviews_percentage"":3},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":26,""reviews_percentage"":10},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":95,""reviews_percentage"":37},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":123,""reviews_percentage"":48}}","""$2.99""",external,external_focus,True

From detecting explosives to eliminating the bad guys, these powerful dogs are also some of the smartest and highest skilled working animals on the planet. Mike Ritland's job is to train them.

This special edition re-telling presents the dramatic tale of how Ritland discovered his passion and grew up to become the trainer of the nation's most elite military working dogs. Ritland was a smaller-than-average kid who was often picked-on at school-which led him to spend more time with dogs at a young age. After graduating BUD/S training-the toughest military training in the world-to become a SEAL, he was on combat deployment in Iraq when he saw a military working dog in action and instantly knew he'd found his true calling.

Ritland started his own company to train and supply working and protection dogs for the U.S. Government, Department of Defense, and other clients. He also started the Warrior Dog Foundation to help retired Special Operations dogs live long and happy lives after their service.

In this intellectual biography, Sebastian de Grazia presents a new vision of Machiavelli that evokes, with uncanny precision, the great Florentine thinker’s presence. After providing an engrossing account of Machiavelli's childhood and the period following his imprisonment and torture, the book turns to an examination of The Prince . The details of Machiavelli’s life never cease to weave in and out of the narrative, as we read how his ideas gather power and coalesce into a unified vision of humankind and the world.

Colonel Thomas Hoyer Monstery was a master swordsman who participated in more than fifty duels, fought under twelve flags, battled gangsters, and was constantly involved in the great conflicts and upheavals of his time. In the 1870s, he began writing his magnum opus—a series of newspaper articles that are now collected here for the first time in Self-Defense for Gentleman and Ladies .
 
In this book, Colonel Monstery presents a unique look into the Victorian-era fighting world. He describes styles such as British “purring” (shin-kicking), Welsh jump-kicking, and American rough-and-tumble fighting, in addition to providing illustrated instruction in the art of gentlemanly self-defense with a cane, staff, or one’s bare hands. Fifty rare drawings and photographs from the period illuminate Monstery’s world, while an extensive glossary of terms and an introductory biography of Colonel Monstery—including fascinating details of his many duels as well as his groundbreaking devotion to teaching fencing and self-defense skills to women—update his text to make it accessible and useful to gentlemen and ladies of any era.

Questions about the nature of money have gained a new urgency in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. Even as many people have less of it, there are more forms and systems of money, from local currencies and social lending to mobile money and Bitcoin. Yet our understanding of what money is―and what it might be―hasn't kept pace. In The Social Life of Money , Nigel Dodd, one of today’s leading sociologists of money, reformulates the theory of the subject for a postcrisis world in which new kinds of money are proliferating.

What counts as legitimate action by central banks that issue currency and set policy? What underpins the right of nongovernmental actors to create new currencies? And how might new forms of money surpass or subvert government-sanctioned currencies? To answer such questions, The Social Life of Money takes a fresh and wide-ranging look at modern theories of money.

One of the book’s central concerns is how money can be wrested from the domination and mismanagement of banks and governments and restored to its fundamental position as the ""claim upon society"" described by Georg Simmel. But rather than advancing yet another critique of the state-based monetary system, The Social Life of Money draws out the utopian aspects of money and the ways in which its transformation could in turn transform society, politics, and economics. The book also identifies the contributions of thinkers who have not previously been thought of as monetary theorists―including Nietzsche, Benjamin, Bataille, Deleuze and Guattari, Baudrillard, Derrida, and Hardt and Negri. The result provides new ways of thinking about money that seek not only to understand it but to change it.","[""Economics"",""Finance"",""Nonfiction"",""Sociology"",""Philosophy"",""Money""]",1/1/2014,2014.0,"{""name"":""Nigel Dodd"",""num_books"":10,""num_followers"":""2""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":0,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":4,""reviews_percentage"":7},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":9,""reviews_percentage"":16},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":27,""reviews_percentage"":49},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":15,""reviews_percentage"":27}}","""$15.37""",external,internal_focus,True

Das »Heilige Land« – in Wirklichkeit ist es ein verdammtes Land, verdammt zum Unfrieden, zu Gewalt und Hoffnungslosigkeit.

The RZA, the Abbot of the Wu-Tang Clan and hip-hop culture's most dynamic genius, imparts the lessons he's learned on the journey that's taken him from the Staten Island projects to international superstar, all along the way a devout student of knowledge in every form he's found it-on the streets, in religion, in martial arts, in chess, in popular culture. Part chronicle of an extraordinary life and part spiritual and philosophical discourse, The Tao of Wu is a nonfiction Siddhartha for the hip-hop generation-an engaging, seeking book that will enlighten, entertain, and inspire.

The legions of Wu-Tang fans are accustomed to this heady mix-their obsession with the band's puzzlelike lyrics and elaborate mythology has propelled the group through fifteen years of dazzling, multiplatform success. In his 2005 bestseller The Wu-Tang Manual, the RZA provided the barest glimpse of how that mythology worked. In The Tao of Wu, he takes us deep inside the complex sense of wisdom and spirituality that has been at the core of his commercial and creative success.

The book is built around major moments in the RZA's life when he was faced with a dramatic turning point, either bad (a potential prison sentence) or good (a record deal that could pull his family out of poverty), and the lessons he took from each experience. His points of view are always surprising and provocative, and reveal a profound, genuine, and abiding wisdom-consistently tempered with humor and peppered with unique, colloquial phraseology.

The Bhagavad Gita, perhaps the most famous of all Indian scriptures, is universally regarded as one of the world's spiritual and literary masterpieces. Richard Davis tells the story of this venerable and enduring book, from its origins in ancient India to its reception today as a spiritual classic that has been translated into more than seventy-five languages. The Gita opens on the eve of a mighty battle, when the warrior Arjuna is overwhelmed by despair and refuses to fight. He turns to his charioteer, Krishna, who counsels him on why he must. In the dialogue that follows, Arjuna comes to realize that the true battle is for his own soul.

Davis highlights the place of this legendary dialogue in classical Indian culture, and then examines how it has lived on in diverse settings and contexts. He looks at the medieval devotional traditions surrounding the divine character of Krishna and traces how the Gita traveled from India to the West, where it found admirers in such figures as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, J. Robert Oppenheimer, and Aldous Huxley. Davis explores how Indian nationalists like Mahatma Gandhi and Swami Vivekananda used the Gita in their fight against colonial rule, and how contemporary interpreters reanimate and perform this classical work for audiences today.

An essential biography of a timeless masterpiece, this book is an ideal introduction to the Gita and its insights into the struggle for self-mastery that we all must wage.","[""Religion"",""History"",""Philosophy"",""Hinduism"",""Biography"",""India"",""Nonfiction"",""Asia""]",1/1/2014,2014.0,"{""name"":""Richard H.

But after a 1903 letter, there is no more mention of her. With nearly nine decades between the birth and our knowledge of the birth, and with scant clues as to the course of her life, the fate of Lieserl Maric Einstein remained a mystery. In many respects, the story of Lieserl is inextricably linked to that of her mother, Mileva Maric, whose own story, as author Michele Zackheim came to learn, was vigilantly guarded for generations by her extended family in Serbia, whose confidence Zackheim had to earn before they would part with family secrets. After five years of travel to Serbian villages wracked by years of strife, painstaking forays into the labyrinth of Central European record-keeping, and hundreds of kitchen-table conversations; after following every lead and every flicker of intuition, and with the support of an international network of women, Michele Zackheim, in this account, has answered the question of what became of Lieserl Maric Einstein.

It shows how the main sites of labor unrest have shifted over time together with the rise or decline of new leading sectors of capitalist development and demonstrates that labor movements have been deeply embedded (as both cause and effect) in world political dynamics.

Our perpetual connectedness gives us endless opportunities to be part of the give-and-take of networking.

Some worry that this new environment makes us isolated and lonely. But in Networked, Lee Rainie and Barry Wellman show how the large, loosely knit social circles of networked individuals expand opportunities for learning, problem solving, decision making, and personal interaction. The new social operating system of ""networked individualism"" liberates us from the restrictions of tightly knit groups; it also requires us to develop networking skills and strategies, work on maintaining ties, and balance multiple overlapping networks. Rainie and Wellman outline the ""triple revolution"" that has brought on this transformation: the rise of social networking, the capacity of the Internet to empower individuals, and the always-on connectivity of mobile devices. Drawing on extensive evidence, they examine how the move to networked individualism has expanded personal relationships beyond households and neighborhoods; transformed work into less hierarchical, more team-driven enterprises; encouraged individuals to create and share content; and changed the way people obtain information.

Yet placebos only work if you believe they work, so the medical confidence in the power of the placebo effect has provided scientific legitimacy to popular claims about the healing power of the mind.

This book looks at modern-day art theft from all angles: art-historical (tracing the lineage from Duchamp to Richard Prince), legal (looking at recent key copyright cases), cultural (drawing links to literary mash-ups and musical sampling), educational (Kenneth Goldsmith's famous 'Uncreativity' classes) and, of course, in terms of current art practice.

From the beginning, the willingness of national leaders to cooperate has been spurred by  the book opens in 1815, amid the rubble of the Napoleonic Empire, as the Concert of Europe was assembled with an avowed mission to prevent any single power from dominating the continent and to stamp out revolutionary agitation before it could lead to war. But if the Concert was a response to Napoleon, internationalism was a response to the Concert, and as courts and monarchs disintegrated they were replaced by revolutionaries and bureaucrats.

19th century internationalists included bomb-throwing anarchists and the secret policemen who fought them, Marxist revolutionaries and respectable free marketeers. But they all embraced nationalism, the age’s most powerful transformative political creed, and assumed that nationalism and internationalism would go hand in hand. The wars of the twentieth century saw the birth of institutions that enshrined many of those ideals in durable structures of authority, most notably the League of Nations in World War I and the United Nations after World War II. 

Throughout this history, we see that international institutions are only as strong as the great powers of the moment allow them to be. The League was intended to prop up the British empire. With Washington taking over world leadership from Whitehall, the United Nations became a useful extension of American power.  But as Mazower shows us, from the late 1960s on, America lost control over the dialogue and the rise of the independent Third World saw a marked shift away from the United Nations and toward more pliable tools such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.  From the 1990s to 2007, Governing the World centers on a new regime of global coordination built upon economic rule-making by central bankers and finance ministers, a regime in which the interests of citizens and workers are trumped by the iron logic of markets.

Now, the era of Western dominance of international life is fast coming to an end and a new multi-centered global balance of forces is emerging. We are living in a time of extreme confusion about the purpose and durability of our international institutions.  History is not prophecy, but Mark Mazower shows us why the current dialectic between ideals and power politics in the international arena is just another stage in an epic two-hundred-year story.","[""History"",""Nonfiction"",""Politics"",""International Relations"",""European History"",""World History"",""Law"",""Political Science"",""Academic"",""School""]",9/13/2012,2012.0,"{""name"":""Mark Mazower"",""num_books"":27,""num_followers"":""358""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":6,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":31,""reviews_percentage"":6},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":137,""reviews_percentage"":26},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":231,""reviews_percentage"":44},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":110,""reviews_percentage"":21}}","""$14.99""",external,external_focus,True

It was first articulated by choreographer Mary Overlie, who broke down the two dominant issues performers deal with—space and time—into six categories. Since that time, directors Anne Bogart and Tina Landau have expanded her notions and adapted them for actors to function together spontaneously and intuitively and to generate bold, theatrical work. The Viewpoints are a set of names given to certain principles of movement through time and space—they constitute a language for talking about what happens on stage. Coupling this with Composition, which is the practice of selecting and arranging the separate components of theatrical language into a cohesive work of art, provides theatre artists with an important new tool for creating and understanding their art form.

The notion that “it’s never too late to reinvent yourself” soars through “The Last Flight,’’ in which a World War I flier who goes forward in time and gets the chance to trade cowardice for heroism. A visit from an angel blares out the wisdom of “follow your passion” in “A Passage for Trumpet.” The meaning of “divided we fall” is driven home with dramatic results when neighbors suspect neighbors of being invading aliens in “The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street.” The old maxim about never judging a book by its cover is given a tasty twist when an alien tome is translated in “To Serve Man.”

Most organizational books are aimed at traditional homemakers, DIYers, and people who seem to have unimaginable amounts of free time.

With the declaration of war in 1939, dashing young publisher, Tom Burns, left his business for the Ministry of Information, the propaganda arm of the British secret services, and found himself in Madrid as press attaché at the British embassy. Spurred on by his deep love of Spain, he threw himself into the propaganda war against the Nazis, who broadcast freely to the Spanish press. Spain was officially ""nonbelligerent"" during the war. But nonbelligerent doesn't mean  Spain held Gibraltar, and so controlled the western Mediterranean. Germany desperately wanted Gibraltar and the Mediterranean for itself, and it was the responsibility of Tom Burns and the rest of the British Ministry of Information to do everything in their power to keep that from happening. Executing that simple objective became complicated as Burns found he was making enemies in England, not least among them Kim Philby and members of MI 6.

This groundbreaking biography by Kevin Maney, acclaimed technology columnist for USA Today, offers fresh insight and new information on one of the twentieth century's greatest business figures. Over the course of forty-two years, Thomas J. Watson took a failing business called The Computer-Tabulating-Recording Company and transformed it into IBM, the world's first and most famous high-tech company. The Maverick and His Machine is the first modern biography of this business titan. Maney secured exclusive access to hundreds of boxes of Watson's long-forgotten papers, and he has produced the only complete picture of Watson the man and Watson the legendary business leader. These uncovered documents reveal new information about how Watson bet the company in the 1920s on tabulating machines-the forerunners to computers-and how he daringly beat the Great Depression of the 1930s. The documents also lead to new insights concerning the controversy that has followed  his suppos ed coll usion with Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime.

Maney paints a vivid portrait of Watson, uncovers his motivations, and offers needed context on his mammoth role in the course of modern business history. Jim Collins, author of the bestsellers Good to Great and Built to Last, writes in the Foreword to Maney's  ""Leaders like Watson are like forces of nature-almost terrifying in their release of energy and unpredictable volatility, but underneath they still adhere to certain patterns and principles. The patterns and principles might be hard to see amidst the melee, but they are there nonetheless. It takes a gifted person of insight to highlight those patterns, and that is exactly what Kevin Maney does in this book.""

The Maverick and His Machine also includes never-before-published photos of Watson from IBM's archives, showing Watson in greater detail than any book ever has before. Essential reading for every businessperson, tech junkie, and IBM follower, the book is also full of the kind of personal detail and reconstructed events that make it a page-turning story for general readers. The Maverick and the Machine is poised to be one of the most important business biographies in years.

Kevin Maney is a nationally syndicated, award-winning technology columnist at USA Today, where he has been since 1985. He is a cover story writer whose story about IBM's bet-the-company move gained him national recognition. He was voted best technology columnist by the business journalism publication TJFR. Marketing Computers magazine has four times named him one of the most influential technology columnists. He is the author of Wiley's MEGAMEDIA  The Inside Story of the Leaders and the Losers in the Exploding Communications Industry, which was a Business Week Bestseller.

Seemingly a conventional young lady, she marries, but shocks friends when she decides to keep her maiden name. After starting graduate school at Columbia University, she does the unthinkable: she first enters into a forbidden relationship with a female colleague, then gets caught up in an all-consuming and secret affair with a brilliant older man. As her sexual awakening continues, she discovers it is possible to be in love with more than one person at the same time.

Or both. Veterans of the war remain largely anonymous figures, accomplices in the mistake. Critically recounting the steps that led to the war, this book does not excuse the mistakes, but it brings those who served out of the shadows.

Enduring Vietnam recounts the experiences of the young Americans who fought in Vietnam and of families who grieved those who did not return. By 1969 nearly half of the junior enlisted men who died in Vietnam were draftees. And their median age was 21—among the non-draftees it was only 20. The book describes the “baby boomers” growing up in the 1950s, why they went into the military, what they thought of the war, and what it was like to serve in “Nam.” And to come home. With a rich narrative of the Battle for “Hamburger Hill,” and through substantial interviews with those who served, the book depicts the cruelty of this war, and its quiet acts of courage.

Llinás""]",4.22,279,29.0,"In I of the Vortex , Rodolfo Llinas, a founding father of modern brain science, presents an original view of the evolution and nature of mind. According to Llinas, the ""mindness state"" evolved to allow predictive interactions between mobile creatures and their environment. He illustrates the early evolution of mind through a primitive animal called the ""sea squirt."" The mobile larval form has a brainlike ganglion that receives sensory information about the surrounding environment. As an adult, the sea squirt attaches itself to a stationary object and then digests most of its own brain. This suggests that the nervous system evolved to allow active movement in animals. To move through the environment safely, a creature must anticipate the outcome of each movement on the basis of incoming sensory data. Thus the capacity to predict is most likely the ultimate brain function. One could even say that Self is the centralization of prediction.

At the heart of Llinas's theory is the concept of oscillation. Many neurons possess electrical activity, manifested as oscillating variations in the minute voltages across the cell membrane. On the crests of these oscillations occur larger electrical events that are the basis for neuron-to-neuron communication. Like cicadas chirping in unison, a group of neurons oscillating in phase can resonate with a distant group of neurons. This simultaneity of neuronal activity is the neurobiological root of cognition. Although the internal state that we call the mind is guided by the senses, it is also generated by the oscillations within the brain. Thus, in a certain sense, one could say that reality is not all ""out there,"" but is a kind of virtual reality.","[""Neuroscience"",""Science"",""Psychology"",""Nonfiction"",""Philosophy"",""Brain"",""School"",""Medicine""]",4/2/2001,2001.0,"{""name"":""Rodolfo R.

Graham""]",4.0,71,6.0,"The Soviet agronomist Trofim Lysenko became one of the most notorious figures in twentieth-century science after his genetic theories were discredited decades ago. Yet some scientists, even in the West, now claim that discoveries in the field of epigenetics prove that he was right after all. Seeking to get to the bottom of Lysenko’s rehabilitation in certain Russian scientific circles, Loren Graham reopens the case, granting his theories an impartial hearing to determine whether new developments in molecular biology validate his claims.

In the 1930s Lysenko advanced a “theory of nutrients” to explain plant development, basing his insights on experiments which, he claimed, showed one could manipulate environmental conditions such as temperature to convert a winter wheat variety into a spring variety. He considered the inheritance of acquired characteristics―which he called the “internalization of environmental conditions”―the primary mechanism of heredity. Although his methods were slipshod and his results were never duplicated, his ideas fell on fertile ground during a time of widespread famine in the Soviet Union.

Recently, a hypothesis called epigenetic transgenerational inheritance has suggested that acquired characteristics may indeed occasionally be passed on to offspring. Some biologists dispute the evidence for this hypothesis. Loren Graham examines these arguments, both in Russia and the West, and shows how, in Russia, political currents are particularly significant in affecting the debates.","[""History"",""Science"",""Russia"",""Biology"",""Nonfiction"",""Soviet Union"",""Politics"",""Russian History"",""Biography"",""Research""]",4/11/2016,2016.0,"{""name"":""Loren R.

What caused millions of young people-many of them affluent and college educated-to suddenly decide that American society needed to be completely overhauled?

In Smoking Typewriters , historian John McMillian shows that one answer to these questions can be found in the emergence of a dynamic underground press in the 1960s. Following the lead of papers like the Los Angeles Free Press, the East Village Other , and the Berkeley Barb , young people across the country launched hundreds of mimeographed pamphlets and flyers, small press magazines, and underground newspapers. New, cheaper printing technologies democratized the publishing process and by the decade's end the combined circulation of underground papers stretched into the millions. Though not technically illegal, these papers were often genuinely subversive, and many of those who produced and sold them-on street-corners, at poetry readings, gallery openings, and coffeehouses-became targets of harassment from local and federal authorities. With writers who actively participated in the events they described, underground newspapers captured the zeitgeist of the '60s, speaking directly to their
readers, and reflecting and magnifying the spirit of cultural and political protest. McMillian pays special attention to the ways underground newspapers fostered a sense of community and played a vital role in shaping the New Left's highly democratic ""movement culture.""

Deeply researched and eloquently written, Smoking Typewriters captures all the youthful idealism and vibrant tumult of the 1960s as it delivers a brilliant reappraisal of the origins and development of the New Left rebellion.","[""History"",""Nonfiction"",""Journalism"",""Politics"",""Activism"",""American History"",""Writing"",""Research"",""Biography""]",1/1/2011,2011.0,"{""name"":""John McMillian"",""num_books"":17,""num_followers"":""28""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":4,""reviews_percentage"":3},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":13,""reviews_percentage"":10},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":28,""reviews_percentage"":22},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":50,""reviews_percentage"":40},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":30,""reviews_percentage"":24}}","""$14.69""",external,external_focus,True

Is it culture, the weather, geography? Perhaps ignorance of what the right policies are? Simply, no. None of these factors is either definitive or destiny. Otherwise, how to explain why Botswana has become one of the fastest growing countries in the world, while other African nations, such as Zimbabwe, the Congo, and Sierra Leone, are mired in poverty and violence? Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson conclusively show that it is man-made political and economic institutions that underlie economic success (or lack of it). Korea, to take just one of their fascinating examples, is a remarkably homogeneous nation, yet the people of North Korea are among the poorest on earth while their brothers and sisters in South Korea are among the richest. The south forged a society that created incentives, rewarded innovation, and allowed everyone to participate in economic opportunities. The economic success thus spurred was sustained because the government became accountable and responsive to citizens and the great mass of people. Sadly, the people of the north have endured decades of famine, political repression, and very different economic institutions—with no end in sight. The differences between the Koreas is due to the politics that created these completely different institutional trajectories. Based on fifteen years of original research Acemoglu and Robinson marshall extraordinary historical evidence from the Roman Empire, the Mayan city-states, medieval Venice, the Soviet Union, Latin America, England, Europe, the United States, and Africa to build a new theory of political economy with great relevance for the big questions of today, including:    - China has built an authoritarian growth machine. Will it continue to grow at such high speed and overwhelm the West?    - Are America’s best days behind it? Are we moving from a virtuous circle in which efforts by elites to aggrandize power are resisted to a vicious one that enriches and empowers a small minority?    - What is the most effective way to help move billions of people from the rut of poverty to prosperity? More philanthropy from the wealthy nations of the West? Or learning the hard-won lessons of Acemoglu and Robinson’s breakthrough ideas on the interplay between inclusive political and economic institutions?

But one semester short of graduating, and newly married, he was called to active duty-to serve in Kuwait, then on the front lines of the invasion of Iraq, and ultimately in Baghdad. While serving in Iraq, Crawford began writing short nonfiction stories, his account of what he and his fellow soldiers experienced in the war.

Randy Frost and Gail Steketee were the first to study hoarding when they began their work a decade ago; they expected to find a few sufferers but ended up treating hundreds of patients and fielding thousands of calls from the families of others. Now they explore the compulsion through a series of compelling case studies in the vein of Oliver Sacks. With vivid portraits that show us the traits by which you can identify a hoarder's piles on sofas and beds that make the furniture useless, houses that can be navigated only by following small paths called goat trails, vast piles of paper that the hoarders ""churn"" but never discard, even collections of animals and garbage; Frost and Steketee illuminate the pull that possessions exert on all of us. Whether we're savers, collectors, or compulsive cleaners, very few of us are in fact free of the impulses that drive hoarders to the extremes in which they live.

The stories of the moon walkers are familiar. Less appreciated are Grissom's contributions. The international prestige of winning the Moon Race cannot be understated, and Grissom played a pivotal and enduring role in securing that legacy for the United States. Indeed, Grissom was first and foremost a Cold Warrior, a member of the first group of Mercury astronauts whose goal it was to beat the Soviet Union into space and eventually to the moon. Drawing on extensive interviews with fellow astronauts, NASA engineers, family members, and friends of Gus Grissom, George Leopold delivers a comprehensive and corrective account of Grissom’s life that places his career in the context of the Cold War and the history of human spaceflight.

Yet, the modern economy was born in Europe. Why was it not born in the Middle East? In this book Jared Rubin examines the role that Islam played in this reversal of fortunes. It argues that the religion itself is not to blame; the importance of religious legitimacy in Middle Eastern politics was the primary culprit. Muslim religious authorities were given an important seat at the political bargaining table, which they used to block important advancements such as the printing press and lending at interest. In Europe, however, the Church played a weaker role in legitimizing rule, especially where Protestantism spread (indeed, the Reformation was successful due to the spread of printing, which was blocked in the Middle East). It was precisely in those Protestant nations, especially England and the Dutch Republic, where the modern economy was born.

Life was imploding around  her parents’ divorce, their spiraling addictions, her deteriorating relationships with them. She lost her virginity at thirteen and began a game of initiating boys her age into manhood. For the fleeting moments she spent in bed with them, she got to be the center of attention.

Divorced from her feelings, tempted into a lifestyle she couldn’t afford, financially or emotionally, she entered Sex Rehab with Dr. Drew to boost her career. But when Dr. Drew and his staff insisted she go by her real name, the once indestructible walls she had built around herself began to burn down.

With the dark came excitement, adventure, and fright in subway tunnels, office towers, busy intersections, high-rise stairwells, hotel lobbies, elevators, and hospitals. There was revelry in bars and restaurants, music and dancing in the streets. On block after block, men and women proved themselves heroes by helping neighbors and strangers make it through the night.

Unfortunately, there was also widespread looting, vandalism, and arson. Even before police restored order, people began to ask and argue about why. Why did people do what they did when the lights went out? The argument raged for weeks but it was just like the  lots of heat, little light--a shouting match between those who held fast to one explanation and those who held fast to another.

James Goodman cuts between accidents, encounters, conversations, exchanges, and arguments to re-create that night and its aftermath in a dizzying accumulation of detail. Rejecting simple dichotomies and one-dimensional explanations for why people act as they do in moments of conflict and crisis, Goodman illuminates attitudes, ideas, and experiences that have been lost in facile generalizations and analyses. Journalistic re-creation at its most exciting, Blackout provides a whirlwind tour of 1970s New York and a challenge to conventional thinking.","[""History"",""Nonfiction"",""New York"",""American History""]",12/12/2003,2003.0,"{""name"":""James  Goodman"",""num_books"":4}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":7,""reviews_percentage"":8},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":10,""reviews_percentage"":12},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":28,""reviews_percentage"":34},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":22,""reviews_percentage"":27},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":14,""reviews_percentage"":17}}","""$14.99""",external,external_focus,True

Albert Einstein, Isaac Asimov, E.M. Forster, Bertrand Russell, and Gloria Steinem all declared themselves humanists. What is humanism and why does it matter? Is there any doctrine every humanist must hold? If it rejects religion, what does it offer in its place? Have the twentieth century's crimes against humanity spelled the end for humanism?

On Humanism is a timely and powerfully argued philosophical defence of humanism. It is also an impassioned plea that we turn to ourselves, not religion, if we want to answer Socrates' age-old  what is the best kind of life to lead? Although humanism has much in common with science, Richard Norman shows that it is far from a denial of the more mysterious, fragile side of being human. He deals with big questions such as the environment, Darwinism and 'creation science', euthanasia and abortion, and then argues that it is ultimately through the human capacity for art, literature and the imagination that humanism is a powerful alternative to religious belief.

Drawing on a varied range of examples from Aristotle to Primo Levi and the novels of Virginia Woolf and Graham Swift, On Humanism is a lucid and much needed reflection on this much talked about but little understood phenomenon.","[""Philosophy"",""Nonfiction"",""Religion""]",6/16/2004,2004.0,"{""name"":""Richard Norman"",""num_books"":42,""num_followers"":""2""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":3,""reviews_percentage"":3},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":8,""reviews_percentage"":8},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":24,""reviews_percentage"":25},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":39,""reviews_percentage"":41},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":21,""reviews_percentage"":22}}","""$31.81""",external,internal_focus,False

Taken as a whole, the projected history represents the culmination of the life work of perhaps the most distinguished historian now writing on Japan. Unlike the renowned Short Cultural History , it is concerned mainly with political and social phenomena and only incidentally touches on religion, literature, and the arts. The treatment is primarily descriptive and factual, but the author offers some pragmatic interpretations and suggests comparisons with the history of other peoples. A History of Japan to 1334 describes the growth from tribal origins of an organized state on a Chinese model, gives a picture of the life of the Royal Court, and examines the conflict between a polished urban nobility and a warlike rural gentry. It traces the evolution of an efficient system of feudal government which deprived the sovereign of all but his ritual functions and the prestige of his ancestry. The structure of Japanese feudal society is depicted in some detail and explained in terms of its internal stresses and its behavior in peace and war, especially during the period of the Mongol attacks in the last decades of the thirteenth century.

Yeats was hailed as ""a work of huge significance"" (The Atlantic Monthly) and ""a stupendous historiographical feat"" (Irish Sunday Independent). Now, the eagerly awaited second volume explores the complex poetic, political, and personal intricacies of Yeats's dramatic final decades, a period that saw the Easter Rebellion, the founding of the Irish state in 1922, and the production of Yeats's greatest masterpieces.

In the conclusion of this first fully authorized biography, Foster brilliantly illuminates the circumstances--the rich internal and external experiences--that shaped the great poetry of Yeats's later years: ""The Wild Swans at Coole,"" ""Sailing to Byzantium,"" ""The Tower,"" ""The Circus Animals Desertion,"" ""Under Ben Bulben,"" and many others. Yeats's pursuit of Irish nationalism and an independent Irish culture, his continued search for supernatural truths through occult experimentation, his extraordinary marriage, a series of tempestuous love affairs, and his lingering obsession with Maud Gonne are all explored here with a nuance and awareness rare in literary biography. Foster gives us the very texture of Yeats's life and thought, revealing the many ways he made poetry out of the ""quarrel"" with himself and the upheaval around him. But this consummate biography also shows that Yeats was much more than simply a lyric poet and examines in great detail Yeats's non-poetic work--his essays, plays, polemics, and memoirs. The enormous and varied circle of Yeats's friends, lovers, family, collaborators and antagonists inhabit and enrich a personal world of astounding energy, artistic commitment and verve; while the poet himself is shown returning again and again to his governing preoccupations, sex and death.

Based on complete and unprecedented access to Yeats's papers and written with extraordinary grace and insight, W.B.

The Israeli barrier is probably the most iconic divider of land since the Berlin Wall. It has been declared illegal under international law and its impact on life in the West Bank has been enormous.

For more than forty years, Frederick Forsyth has been writing extraordinary real-world novels of intrigue, from the groundbreaking The Day of the Jackal to the prescient The Kill List . Whether writing about the murky world of arms dealers, the shadowy Nazi underground movement, or the intricacies of worldwide drug cartels, every plot has been chillingly plausible because every detail has been minutely researched.

But what most people don’t know is that some of his greatest stories of intrigue have been in his own life.

He was the RAF’s youngest pilot at the age of nineteen, barely escaped the wrath of an arms dealer in Hamburg, got strafed by a MiG during the Nigerian civil war, landed during a bloody coup in Guinea-Bissau (and was accused of helping fund a 1973 coup in Equatorial Guinea). The Stasi arrested him, the Israelis feted him, the IRA threatened him, and a certain attractive Czech secret police agent—well, her actions were a bit more intimate. And that’s just for starters.

Quentin Skinner gives an outline account of all the principal texts of the period, discussing in turn the chief political writings of Dante, Marsiglio, Bartolus, Machiavelli, Erasmus and more, Luther and Calvin, Bodin and the Calvinist revolutionaries. But he also examines a very large number of lesser writers in order to explain the general social and intellectual context in which these leading theorists worked. He thus presents the history not as a procession of 'classic texts' but are more readily intelligible. He traces by this means the gradual emergence of the vocabulary of modern political thought, and in particular the crucial concept of the State.

Fernicola""]",3.77,580,67.0,"An account of the 1916 New Jersey shark attacks that inspired Peter Benchley's Jaws chronicles the twelve-day period during which four swimmers were killed and a fifth seriously injured, examining clues and evidence to consider what actually took place.

Review:
""Beginning July 1, 1916, a spate of shark attacks off the Jersey shore befuddled maritime experts and terrified the public. In the first incident, an unsuspecting vacationer's thigh was bitten off; he eventually died. Over the next 12 days, three more people were killed and another seriously injured. These two books by New Jersey authors re-create differing theories as to who, and what, was responsible for the carnage, a subject that scientists still debate today. Philadelphia Inquirer journalist Capuzzo (nominated four times for a Pulitzer) unwaveringly adheres to the most popular theory (that a single, juvenile great white shark was responsible for all the carnage), but his book's strength lies in its lively reconstruction of the age and its consciousness, in which a new leisure class was emerging, with many of its members venturing into the ocean for the first time. (He also recounts the shark's movements and supposed feelings from an omniscient, third-person perspective to strained, unintentionally comical and inevitably misleading effect.) The encounters between people and sharks make for some tense and gruesome reading, and the rest of the book is equally page-turning: the zeal to find the ""Jersey man-eater,"" the sensational ""feeding frenzy"" of the press and the befuddlement of a scientific community, which then devoutly believed that sharks did not bite humans. On that last front, Fernicola, a physician specializing in post-stroke and post-injury recovery, adds to his own investigation of this episode an exhaustive review of shark science today and theories of shark aggression toward humans, including possible environmental factors (heat, changes in human bathing habits, even bathing suit styles), speculations on the perpetrator's exact species, and well-reasoned arguments and conclusions. Fernicola is a recognized authority on the 1916 attacks (his work has provided the basis for Discovery Channel and History Channel documentaries on the subject), but he marshals so much data that his book fails to live up to its lurid title, giving its looming competitor the edge. (May; Capuzzo on-sale: May 8) Forecast: With bathing suit season just around the corner, these books are well timed. Fernicola's, which will be the subject of an upcoming spread in USA Today and is scheduled for coverage on Good Day New York, will provide grist to shark enthusiasts and fans of the Jaws films. Lyons Press has high hopes for its book and has committed to an unprecedented (for this house) 50,000 first printing. Capuzzo will tour six major cities on both coasts, along with stops on Cape Cod and, of course, the Jersey shore. His compulsive potboiler just may be the hot read on the beach this summer."" - Publishers Weekly","[""History"",""Nonfiction"",""American History"",""Animals"",""Science"",""Historical"",""Nature"",""Wildlife"",""Research"",""War""]",1/1/2001,2001.0,"{""name"":""Richard G.

Murderers, rapists, and armed robbers were competing in the annual rodeo at Angola, the grim maximum-security penitentiary in Louisiana. The convicts, sentenced to life without parole, were thrown, trampled, and gored by bucking bulls and broncos before thousands of cheering spectators. But amid the brutality of this gladiatorial spectacle Bergner caught surprising glimpses of exaltation, hints of triumphant skill.

The incongruity of seeing hope where one would expect only hopelessness, self-control in men who were there because they'd had none, sparked an urgent quest in him. Having gained unlimited and unmonitored access, Bergner spent an unflinching year inside the harsh world of Angola. He forged relationships with seven prisoners who left an indelible impression on him. There's Johnny Brooks, seemingly a latter-day Stepin Fetchit, who, while washing the warden's car, longs to be a cowboy and to marry a woman he meets on the rodeo grounds. Then there's Danny Fabre, locked up for viciously beating a woman to death, now struggling to bring his reading skills up to a sixth-grade level. And Terry Hawkins, haunted nightly by the ghost of his victim, a ghost he tries in vain to exorcise in a prison church that echoes with the cries of convicts talking in tongues.

Looming front and center is Warden Burl Cain, the larger-than-life ruler of Angola who quotes both Jesus and Attila the Hun, declares himself a prophet, and declaims that redemption is possible for even the most depraved criminal. Cain welcomes Bergner in, and so begins a journey that takes the author deep into a forgotten world and forces him to question his most closely held beliefs. The climax of his story is as unexpected as it is wrenching.
        
Rendered in luminous prose, God of the Rodeo is an exploration of the human spirit, yielding in the process a searing portrait of a place that will be impossible to forget and a group of men, guilty of unimaginable crimes, desperately seeking a moment of grace.","[""Nonfiction"",""Sociology"",""Memoir"",""Biography"",""Crime"",""Southern""]",1/1/1998,1998.0,"{""name"":""Daniel Bergner"",""num_books"":16,""num_followers"":""61""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":4,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":11,""reviews_percentage"":4},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":75,""reviews_percentage"":32},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":91,""reviews_percentage"":39},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":48,""reviews_percentage"":20}}","""$14.99""",external,external_focus,True

An anthology used in Tennessee schools changed ""By God!"" to ""By gum!"" and ""My God!"" to ""You don't mean it."" The New York State Education Department omitted mentioning Jews in an Isaac Bashevis Singer story about prewar Poland, or blacks in Annie Dillard's memoir of growing up in a racially mixed town. California rejected a reading book because The Little Engine That Could was male. Diane Ravitch maintains that America's students are compelled to read insipid texts that have been censored and bowdlerized, issued by publishers who willingly cut controversial material from their books--a case of the bland leading the bland. The Language Police is the first full-scale expose of this cultural and educational scandal, written by a leading historian. It documents the existence of an elaborate and well-established protocol of beneficent censorship, quietly endorsed and implemented by test makers and textbook publishers, states, and the federal government. School boards and bias and sensitivity committees review, abridge, and modify texts to delete potentially offensive words, topics, and imagery. Publishers practice self-censorship to sell books in big states. To what exactly do the censors object? A typical publisher's guideline advises that - Women cannot be depicted as caregivers or doinghousehold chores.- Men cannot be lawyers or doctors or plumbers. They must be nurturing helpmates.- Old people cannot be feeble or dependent; they must jog or repair the roof.- A story that is set in the mountains discriminates against students from flatlands.- Children cannot be shown as disobedient or in conflict with adults.- Cake cannot appear in a story because it is not nutritious. The result of these revisions are--no surprise!--boring, inane texts about a cotton-candy world bearing no resemblance to what children can access with the click of a remote control or a computer mouse. Sadly, data show that these efforts to sanitize language do not advance learning or bolster test scores, the very reason given for banning allegedly insensitive words and topics. Ravitch offers a powerful political and economic analysis of the causes of censorship. She has practical and sensible solutions for ending it, which will improve the quality of books for students as well as liberating publishers, state boards of education, and schools from the grip of pressure groups.

Muslim Zion cuts to the core of the geopolitical paradoxes entangling Pakistan to argue that India’s rival has never been a nation-state in the conventional sense. Pakistan is instead a distinct type of political geography, ungrounded in the historic connections of lands and peoples, whose context is provided by the settler states of the New World but whose closest ideological parallel is the state of Israel.

A year before the 1948 establishment of Israel, Pakistan was founded on a philosophy that accords with Zionism in surprising ways. Faisal Devji understands Zion as a political form rather than a holy land, one that rejects hereditary linkages between ethnicity and soil in favor of membership based on nothing but an idea of belonging. Like Israel, Pakistan came into being through the migration of a minority population, inhabiting a vast subcontinent, who abandoned old lands in which they feared persecution to settle in a new homeland. Just as Israel is the world’s sole Jewish state, Pakistan is the only country to be established in the name of Islam.

Revealing how Pakistan’s troubled present continues to be shaped by its past, Muslim Zion is a penetrating critique of what comes of founding a country on an unresolved desire both to join and reject the world of modern nation-states.","[""Pakistan"",""History"",""Islam"",""Politics"",""Nonfiction"",""India"",""Religion""]",5/15/2013,2013.0,"{""name"":""Faisal Devji"",""num_books"":25,""num_followers"":""8""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":4,""reviews_percentage"":6},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":4,""reviews_percentage"":6},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":24,""reviews_percentage"":36},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":24,""reviews_percentage"":36},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":10,""reviews_percentage"":15}}","""$27.99""",external,external_focus,True

Six times he was exiled to Siberia for his illicit activities, escaping many times despite below freezing temperatures and on one occasion an attack by a pack of wolves. His instinctive ability to command authority and divide the opposition through lies and deceit set him on a path he would follow to become Russia's most absolute dictator. He was never reticent to shed innocent blood in the pursuit of his own ends, and he carefully orchestrated demonstrations that brought about massacres that he then used to his own revolutionary ends.

His vision was far reaching, and while his initial purpose was to establish a Soviet socialist state his larger goal was world domination.

Gay is a subculture, a slur, a set of gestures, a slang, a look, a posture, a parade, a rainbow flag, a film genre, a taste in music, a hairstyle, a marketing demographic, a bumper sticker, a political agenda and philosophical viewpoint. Gay is a pre-packaged, superficial persona – a lifestyle. It's a sexual identity that has almost nothing to do with sexuality. Androphilia is a rejection of the overloaded gay identity and a return to a discussion of homosexuality in terms of desire. Homosexual men have been paradoxically cast as the enemies of masculinity – slaves to the feminist pipe dream of a ""gender-neutral"" (read: anti-male, pro-female) world. 

Androphilia is a manifesto full of truly dangerous ideas: that men can have sex with men and retain their manhood, that homosexuality can be about championing a masculine ideal rather than attacking it, and that the ""oppressive construct of masculinity,"" despised by the gay community could actually enrich and improve the lives of homosexual and bisexual men. 

Androphilia is for those men who never really bought what the gay community was selling. It is a challenge to leave the gay world completely behind and to rejoin the world of men, unapologetically, as androphliles, but more importantly, as men.","[""Nonfiction"",""Essays"",""Academic"",""Philosophy"",""History"",""Sexuality""]",3/1/2007,2007.0,"{""name"":""Jack   Donovan"",""num_books"":7,""num_followers"":""465""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":30,""reviews_percentage"":16},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":19,""reviews_percentage"":10},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":40,""reviews_percentage"":22},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":41,""reviews_percentage"":22},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":50,""reviews_percentage"":27}}",,external,external_focus,True

Hatch""]",4.04,203,34.0,"There's a running joke among radiologists: finding a tumor in a mammogram is akin to finding a snowball in a blizzard. A bit of medical gallows humor, this simile illustrates the difficulties of finding signals (the snowball) against a background of noise (the blizzard). Doctors are faced with similar difficulties every day when sifting through piles of data from blood tests to X-rays to endless lists of patient symptoms. Diagnoses are often just educated guesses, and prognoses less certain still. There is a significant amount of uncertainty in the daily practice of medicine, resulting in confusion and potentially deadly complications. 
Dr. Steven Hatch argues that instead of ignoring this uncertainty, we should embrace it. By digging deeply into a number of rancorous controversies, from breast cancer screening to blood pressure management, Hatch shows us how medicine can fail--sometimes spectacularly--when patients and doctors alike place too much faith in modern medical technology. The key to good health might lie in the ability to recognize the hype created by so many medical reports, sense when to push a physician for more testing, or resist a physician's enthusiasm when unnecessary tests or treatments are being offered. 
Both humbling and empowering, Snowball in a Blizzard lays bare the inescapable murkiness that permeates the theory and practice of modern medicine. Essential reading for physicians and patients alike, this book shows how, by recognizing rather than denying that uncertainty, we can all make better health decisions.","[""Nonfiction"",""Science"",""Medicine"",""Medical"",""Health"",""Health Care""]",2/23/2016,2016.0,"{""name"":""Steven C.

The solution to the ice age mystery originated when the National Science Foundation organized the CLIMAP project to study changes in the earth’s climate over the past 700,000 years. One of the goals was to produce a map of the earth during the last ice age. Scientists examined cores of sediment from the Indian Ocean bed and deciphered a continuous history for the past 500,000 years. Their work ultimately confirmed the theory that the earth’s irregular orbital motions account for the bizarre climatic changes which bring on ice ages.

This is a tale of scientific discovery and the colorful people who participated: Louis Agassiz, the young Swiss naturalist whose geological studies first convinced scientists that the earth has recently passed through an ice age; the Reverend William Buckland, an eccentric but respected Oxford professor who fought so hard against the ice-age theory before accepting it; James Croll, a Scots mechanic who educated himself as a scientist and first formulated the astronomic theory of ice ages; Milutin Milankovitch, the Serbian mathematician who gave the astronomic theory its firm quantitative foundation; and the many other astronomers, geochemists, geologists, paleontologists, and geophysicists who have been engaged for nearly a century and a half in the pressing search for a solution to the ice-age mystery.","[""Nonfiction"",""Science"",""History"",""Natural History"",""Geography"",""Nature"",""Geology""]",1/1/1979,1979.0,"{""name"":""John Imbrie"",""num_books"":7,""num_followers"":""1""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":3,""reviews_percentage"":2},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":5,""reviews_percentage"":4},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":29,""reviews_percentage"":26},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":38,""reviews_percentage"":35},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":33,""reviews_percentage"":30}}",,external,external_focus,True

Here is a comprehensive and practical guide to an understanding of dreams in light of the basic principles of Jung's Analytical Psychology. Jung's model of the psyche is concisely described and discussed, with many clinical examples of dreams and how they may be interpreted in context. Particular attention is given to common and recurrent dream motifs, traumatic dreams, compensatory and purposive functions of dreams, dreams as prognostic of illness or physical change, and how dreams are related to the stage of life and individuation process of the dreamer.","[""Psychology"",""Philosophy"",""Nonfiction""]",1/1/1983,1983.0,"{""name"":""James A.

Deep ethical questions that have bedeviled philosophers for ages will suddenly arrive on the steps of our courthouses. Can a machine be held accountable for its actions? Should intelligent systems enjoy independent rights and responsibilities, or are they simple property? Who should be held responsible when a self-driving car kills a pedestrian?

McRobbie trenchantly argues that it is precisely on these grounds that invidious forms of gender -re-stabilisation are able to be re-established. Consumer culture, she argues, encroaches on the terrain of so called female freedom, appears supportive of female success only to tie women into new post-feminist neurotic dependencies.

Classrooms were never sufficient for Jared Cohen; he wanted to learn about global affairs by witnessing them firsthand. During his undergraduate years Cohen travelled extensively to Africa—often to wartorn countries, putting himself at risk to see the world firsthand. While studying on a Rhodes Scholarship at Oxford, he took a crash course in Arabic, read voraciously on the history and culture of the Middle East, and in 2004 he embarked on the first of a series of incredible journeys to the Middle East. In an effort to try to understand the spread of radical Islamist violence, he focused his research on Muslim youth. The result is Children of Jihad, a portrait of paradox that probes much deeper than any journalist or pundit ever could.  Written with candor and featuring dozens of eye-opening photographs, Cohen’s account begins in Lebanon, where he interviews Hezbollah members at, of all places, a McDonald’s. In Iran, he defies government threats and sneaks into underground parties, where bootleg liquor, Western music, and the Internet are all easy to access. His risky itinerary also takes him to a Palestinian refugee camp in southern Lebanon, borderlands in Syria, the insurgency hotbed of Mosul, and other frontline locales. At each turn, he observes a culture at an uncanny crossroads: Bedouin shepherds with satellite dishes to provide Western TV shows, young women wearing garish makeup despite religious mandates, teenagers sending secret text messages and arranging illicit trysts.

Britain in the Viking Age was a turbulent violent place, and the war-lords of the age have names that fire the blood and stir the imagination – Alfred the Great and Ivar the Boneless, Edmund Ironside and Erik Bloodaxe, Macbeth and Thorfinn Skullsplitter (to name but a few). The way in which their stories intersect with real places offers potential for a richly textured narrative. By drawing together narrative history, new academic research and first-hand experience, Tom Williams offers a vital evocation of a forgotten world, its echoes in later history and its implications for the present.

A Viking Britain truly existed, and its historical and cultural footprint is in many ways broader and deeper than Rome’s. Between the conventional beginning of the Viking Age in the late eighth century and its close in the eleventh, Scandinavian people and culture were involved with Britain to a degree that has left a permanent impression on these islands. They came to plunder and, ultimately, to settle, to colonize and to rule. By the time of the Norman Conquest, much of Britain might justifiably be described as ‘Viking’, and in language, literature, place-names and folklore, the presence of Scandinavian settlers can still be felt. Indeed, the Vikings have been a powerful cultural force in modern times. Their representation in paintings, novels and operas – from the music of Elgar to the writing of Kipling, Morris and Tolkien – has had a profound impact on the British psyche. Much of what we imagine when we think of the Vikings – even the word ‘Viking’ itself – grew, not form the Viking Age itself, but from the political, literary and artistic currents of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Here, too, a Viking Britain came alive.","[""History"",""Nonfiction"",""Audiobook"",""British Literature"",""Medieval"",""Historical"",""Medieval History"",""Anglo Saxon"",""Ancient History"",""Travel""]",6/1/2017,2017.0,"{""name"":""Thomas  Williams"",""num_books"":6,""num_followers"":""20""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":11,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":44,""reviews_percentage"":4},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":234,""reviews_percentage"":24},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":440,""reviews_percentage"":45},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":233,""reviews_percentage"":24}}",,external,external_focus,True

Der er en sjælden kraft i hans ord, som giver os glimt af en større virkelighed. En virkelighed vi tager del i, når vi er fuldkomne nærværende og slipper vores stadige grublen over fortiden og bekymring for fremtiden. Eckhart Tolle introducerer begrebet ´smertekroppen´ som betegnelse for summen af de negative følelser som den enkelte har ´sparet sammen´ gennem livet og bærer på. Smertekroppen er sammen med vores identifikation med sindet og tankerne de to største forhindringer for at opnå spirituel frigørelse. Der er en guldgrube af indsigter i Nuets kraft: - Vi er ikke vores sind og tanker - Vi kan finde vej ud af psykologisk smerte - Der er autentisk styrke i at overgive sig - Kroppen er en indgang til totalt nærvær - Stilheden og rummet, der omgiver os, er veje til Nuets kraft - Også parforhold kan fungere som en nøgle, når de bruges til at blive mere bevidste og dermed mere kærlige.

Laura Doyle's marriage was in trouble, and couples counseling wasn't helping. On the brink of divorce, she decided to talk to women who'd been happily married for over a decade, and their advice stunned her. From it, she distilled Six Intimacy Skills—woman-centric practices that ended her overwhelm and resentment, restoring the playfulness and passion in her marriage.

To hear Danton speak, his booming voice a roll of thunder, excited bourgeois reformers and the street alike; his impassioned speeches, often hours long, drove the sans culottes to action and kept the Revolution alive. But as the newly appointed Minister of Justice, Danton struggled to steer the increasingly divided Revolutionary government. Working tirelessly to halt the bloodshed of Robespierre’s Terror, he ultimately became another of its victims. True to form, Danton did not go easily to the guillotine; at his trial, he defended himself with such vehemence that the tribunal convicted him before he could rally the crowd in his favor.

Torrey""]",4.36,72,14.0,"Despite a strategically vulnerable position, an ill-prepared army, and questionable promises of military support from the Allied Powers, Romania intervened in World War I in August 1916. In return, it received the Allies' formal sanction for the annexation of the Romanian-inhabited regions of Austria-Hungary. As Glenn Torrey reveals in his pathbreaking study, this soon appeared to have been an impulsive and risky decision for both parties.

Torrey details how, by the end of 1916, the armies of the Central Powers, led by German generals Falkenhayn and Mackensen, had administered a crushing defeat and occupied two-thirds of Romanian territory, but at the cost of diverting substantial military forces they needed on other fronts. The Allies, especially the Russians, were forced to do likewise in order to prevent Romania from collapsing completely.

Torrey presents the most authoritative account yet of the heavy fighting during the 1916 campaign and of the renewed attempt by Austro-German forces, including the elite Alpine Corps, to subdue the Romanian Army in the summer of 1917. This latter campaign, highlighted here but ignored in non-Romanian accounts, witnessed reorganized and rearmed Romanian soldiers, with help from a disintegrating Russian Army, administer a stunning defeat of their enemies. However, as Torrey also shows, amidst the chaos of the Russian Revolution the Central Powers forced Romania to sign a separate peace early in 1918. Ultimately, this allowed the Romanian Army to reenter the war and occupy the majority of the territory promised in 1916.

Torrey's unparalleled familiarity with archival and secondary sources and his long experience with the subject give authority and balance to his account of the military, strategic, diplomatic, and political events on both sides of the battlefront. In addition, his use of personal memoirs provides vivid insights into the human side of the war. Major military leaders in the Second World War, especially Ion Antonescu and Erwin Rommel, made their careers during the First World War and play a prominent role in his book.

Torrey's study fosters a genuinely new appreciation and understanding of a long-neglected aspect of World War I that influenced not only the war itself but the peace settlement that followed and, in fact, continues today.","[""History"",""World War I"",""Nonfiction"",""Military History""]",1/1/2011,2011.0,"{""name"":""Glenn E.

Was the Cat in the Hat Black? presents five serious critiques of the history and current state of children's literature tempestuous relationship with both implicit and explicit forms of racism. The book fearlessly examines topics both vivid-such as The Cat in the Hat's roots in blackface minstrelsy-and more opaque, like how the children's book industry can perpetuate structural racism via whitewashed covers even while making efforts to increase diversity. Rooted in research yet written with a lively, crackling touch, Nel delves into years of literary criticism and recent sociological data in order to show a better way forward. Though much of what is proposed here could be endlessly argued, the knowledge that what we learn in childhood imparts both subtle and explicit lessons about whose lives matter is not debatable. 

The text concludes with a short and stark proposal of actions everyone-reader, author, publisher, scholar, citizen- can take to fight the biases and prejudices that infect children's literature.

The second copy, reassembled painfully by scientists working under impossible conditions of repression, was sent via a courier to the Vatican. Its receipt was never acknowledged, no word was ever heard from the courier - the manuscript and all the valuable data was lost. The third copy was produced after one of the scientists working on the project escaped to America in the 1980s. Zbigniew Brzezinski suppressed it.    Political Ponerology was forged in the crucible of the very subject it studies. Scientists living under an oppressive regime decide to study it clinically, to study the founders and supporters of an evil regime to determine what common factor is at play in the rise and propagation of man's inhumanity to man.    Shocking in its clinically spare descriptions of the true nature of evil, poignant in the more literary passages where the author reveals the suffering experienced by the researchers who were contaminated or destroyed by the disease they were studying, this is a book that should be required reading by every citizen of every country that claims a moral or humanistic foundation. For it is a certainty that morality and humanism cannot long withstand the predations of Evil.

They explain: You will come away with a very different idea as to what family wealth is all about. It is not stodgy. Not boring. Not moss-backed and reactionary.

If we can just find that great job, win that next promotion, lose those five pounds, happiness will follow. But recent discoveries in the field of positive psychology have shown that this formula is actually backward: Happiness fuels success, not the other way around. When we are positive, our brains become more engaged, creative, motivated, energetic, resilient, and productive at work. This isn’t just an empty mantra. This discovery has been repeatedly borne out by rigorous research in psychology and neuroscience, management studies, and the bottom lines of organizations around the globe.             In The Happiness Advantage, Shawn Achor, who spent over a decade living, researching, and lecturing at Harvard University, draws on his own research—including one of the largest studies of happiness and potential at Harvard and others at companies like UBS and KPMG—to fix this broken formula. Using stories and case studies from his work with thousands of Fortune 500 executives in 42 countries, Achor explains how we can reprogram our brains to become more positive in order to gain a competitive edge at work.             Isolating seven practical, actionable principles that have been tried and tested everywhere from classrooms to boardrooms, stretching from Argentina to Zimbabwe, he shows us how we can capitalize on the Happiness Advantage to improve our performance and maximize our potential. Among the principles he outlines:      • The Tetris Effect: how to retrain our brains to spot patterns of possibility, so we can see—and seize—opportunities wherever we look.    • The Zorro Circle: how to channel our efforts on small, manageable goals, to gain the leverage to gradually conquer bigger and bigger ones.    • Social Investment: how to reap the dividends of investing in one of the greatest predictors of success and happiness—our social support network  A must-read for everyone trying to excel in a world of increasing workloads, stress, and negativity, The Happiness Advantage isn’t only about how to become happier at work.

ينشأ الطفل الذكر منذ صغره على الصلابة والجلد وكبت مشاعره وحبس مخاوفه وقلقه وهو ما يدفعنا ويدفعهم إلى مجابهة مواقف صعبة لا قبل له بها منذ سن مبكرة للغاية بدءا من مرحلة الطفولة ومروراً بالمراهقة وحتى سن النضج فالهرم.

إن جهلنا بطبيعة الذكر هو ما زج بالرجل في هذه الهوة العميقة من المعاناة. فهو يحتاج الى كل المساندة والدعم والحب. إن افتراضنا بأن الرجل مكمن القوة والقدرة المطلقة هو ما جعلنا لا نشعر بأن له جوانب ضعف ولحظات انهيار يمكن ان تودي بحياته.
لقد تعلم الرجل منذ صغره كيف يتحمل في صمت ويجابه في جلد ويخفي كل قلقه ومخاوفه وهو ما يجعله عرضة لمواقف وصدمات لا قبل له بها.

وحتى عندما يجابه الرجل بمثل هذه الصدمات فإنه لا يبادر بطلب النصح أو المساعدة حفاظا على الصورة التي نشأ عليها كرجل.
لقد حان وقت تغيير هذا المفهوم الخاطىء واستشعار معاناة الرجل منذ الطفولة وحتى الهرم والسماح له بالإفصاح عن كل ما يجول في نفسه و احتواء مخاوفه وقلقه وبشريته وتشجيعه على المزيد من الاسهام في الجوانب الإنسانية. عندها سوف نقدر الرجولة الحقة ونحتفي بها و نثري بها حياتنا وحاضرنا ومستقبلنا.

He believed that somewhere there must be a passageway-an unknown straight-connecting the Atlantic Ocean with the mysterious sea beyond, and he was determined to find it. He what been refused ships and men by his own King Manuel of Portugal, but the King of Spain had supplied them.
Only a few men had faith in the venture, and not even Magellan foresaw the difficulties that were in store for him. For, in addition to the perils of sailing uncharted seas, he found himself faced with villainous plots against against his life instigated by the jealous King of Portugal, and intrigue and treachery at the hands of his own mutinous crew.

Le Clézio here conjures the consciousness of Mexico, powerfully evoking the dreams that made and unmade an ancient culture. Le Clézio’s haunting book takes us into the dream that was the religion of the Aztecs, a religion whose own apocalyptic visions anticipated the coming of the Spanish conquerors. Here the dream of the conquistadores rises before us, too, the glimmering idea of gold drawing Europe into the Mexican dream. Against the religion and thought of the Aztecs and the Tarascans and the Europeans in Mexico, Le Clézio also shows us those of the “barbarians” of the north, the nomadic Indians beyond the pale of the Aztec frontier. Finally, Le Clézio’s book is a dream of the present, a meditation on what in Amerindian civilizations—in their language, in their way of telling tales, of wanting to survive their own destruction—moved the poet, playwright, and actor Antonin Artaud and motivates Le Clézio in this book. His own deep identification with pre-Columbian cultures, whose faith told them the wheel of time would bring their gods and their beliefs back to them, finds fitting expression in this extraordinary book, which brings the dream around.

“We are lucky to have in Le Clézio a writer of great quality who brings his particular sensibility and talent here to remind us of the very nature of the rituals and myths of the civilizations of ancient Mexico; he provides us with descriptions as precise as they are mysterious.” —Le Figaro

The vivid oral histories in Arlene Alda's Just Kids from the Bronx reveal what it was like to grow up in the place that bred the influencers in just about every field of endeavor.

When twenty-five-year-old Harry Walker was killed by a bear in Yellowstone Park in 1972, the civil trial prompted by his death became a proxy for bigger questions about American wilderness management that had been boiling for a century. At immediate issue was whether the Park Service should have done more to keep bears away from humans, but what was revealed as the trial unfolded was just how fruitless our efforts to regulate nature in the parks had always been. The proceedings drew to the witness stand some of the most important figures in twentieth century wilderness management, including the eminent zoologist A. Starker Leopold, who had produced a landmark conservationist document in the 1950s, and all-American twin researchers John and Frank Craighead, who ran groundbreaking bear studies at Yellowstone. Their testimony would help decide whether the government owed the Walker family restitution for Harry's death, but it would also illuminate decades of patchwork efforts to preserve an idea of nature that had never existed in the first place.  

In this remarkable excavation of American environmental history, nature writer and former park ranger Jordan Fisher Smith uses Harry Walker's story to tell the larger narrative of the futile, sometimes fatal, attempts to remake wilderness in the name of preserving it. Tracing a course from the founding of the national parks through the tangled twentieth-century growth of the conservationist movement, Smith gives the lie to the portrayal of national parks as Edenic wonderlands unspoiled until the arrival of Europeans, and shows how virtually every attempt to manage nature in the parks has only created cascading effects that require even more management. Moving across time and between Yellowstone, Yosemite, and Glacier national parks, Engineering Eden shows how efforts at wilderness management have always been undone by one fundamental problem--that the idea of what is ""wild"" dissolves as soon as we begin to examine it, leaving us with little framework to say what wilderness should look like and which human interventions are acceptable in trying to preserve it.    

In the tradition of John McPhee's The Control of Nature and Alan Burdick's Out of Eden, Jordan Fisher Smith has produced a powerful work of popular science and environmental history, grappling with critical issues that we have even now yet to resolve.","[""Nonfiction"",""History"",""Nature"",""Science"",""Environment"",""Outdoors"",""Ecology"",""Animals"",""Crime"",""Conservation""]",6/7/2016,2016.0,"{""name"":""Jordan Fisher Smith"",""num_books"":5,""num_followers"":""34""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":6,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":27,""reviews_percentage"":3},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":128,""reviews_percentage"":17},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":304,""reviews_percentage"":42},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":252,""reviews_percentage"":35}}","""$14.82""",external,internal_focus,False

· Invest with a thesis using a specific, appropriate 3-5-year goal

· Create a blueprint for change--a road map for initiatives that will generate the most value for your company within that time frame

· Measure only what matters--such as cash, key market intelligence, and critical operating data

· Hire, motivate, and retain hungry managers--people who think like owners

· Make equity sweat--by making cash scarce, and forcing managers to redeploy underperforming capital in productive directions

Ozzy was the singer in the heavy metal band Black Sabbath, and they meant business. In an era when rock bands were measured by how 'heavy' they were, no one was weightier than Black Sabbath. All four founding members of the original Black Sabbath grew up within half-a-mile of each other in a tiny Birmingham suburb.

This is the story of how they made that dream come true--and how it then turned into a nightmare for all of them.

It finally came to a head when in 1979 they sacked  ""For being too out of control--even for us,"" as Bill Ward put it. The next fifteen years were a war between the post-Ozzy Sabbath and Ozzy himself, whose solo career overshadowed Sabbath so much that a reunion was entirely on his terms.

In a series of brilliant but meticulous studies, he ranges widely across the domains of painting, music, literature and the plastic arts, his fertile mind opening more general, philosophical perspectives.Look, Listen, Read begins with an analysis of Nicolas Poussin’s method of visual composition, and after drawing a surprising parallel with Marcel Proust, moves into a fascinating discussion, joined by Ingres and Delacroix among others, on the art of painting. Next the author turns to music, taking his inspiration from an inquiry into certain chord modulations in Rameau’s opera Castor et Pollux, which at the time of its composition were considered a musical breakthrough. The book then considers the nature of the “beautiful.” The reference point here remains the French Enlightenment, and in particular Diderot’s reflections on painting. Focusing on the aesthetic controversies of this same period, but with regard to music, a fascinating series of chapters revives the work of the largely forgotten eighteenth-century musicologist Michel-Paul-Guy de Chabanon and his surprisingly contemporary discussion of music’s partial resemblance to language. This leads to a consideration of the relations of words to music in opera, where Lévi-Strauss reveals something of his own tastes in music while engaging in a critical review of a work by his recently deceased friend and colleague, Michel Leires. The relation between sounds and colors is considered next, largely through a breathtaking examination of a famous but difficult poem by Arthur Rimbaud. There follows an exchange of notes with André Breton, written some fifty years ago, on the nature of the work of art. In the book’s concluding chapters the author dons the more familiar mantle of the anthropologist, and by looking at the myths of the American Indians, offering an analysis of their understanding of the place of art and of the artist in their own societies.Look, Listen, Read is a truly original work, far removed from the intellectual fads that mark contemporary discussions on aesthetics, as Lévi-Strauss advances into new territory even as he remains faithful to his structuralist inspiration. The book weaves a dense tissue of connections, correspondences, and principles, while at the same time remaining sensitive to the specificities of each of the beaux-arts. In a valedictory statement capping a lifetime’s work, Lévi-Strauss has made a major new contribution to our understanding of the place of art in human life, the nature of its appeal, the source of its creativity, and its universality.","[""Philosophy"",""Art"",""Anthropology"",""Essays"",""Nonfiction""]",1/1/1993,1993.0,"{""name"":""Claude Lévi-Strauss"",""num_books"":211,""num_followers"":""780""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":4,""reviews_percentage"":5},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":32,""reviews_percentage"":43},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":23,""reviews_percentage"":31},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":14,""reviews_percentage"":18}}","""$10.99""",external,internal_focus,False

https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6452749-bright-sided,6452749-bright-sided,Bright-Sided: How the Relentless Promotion of Positive Thinking Has Undermined America,"[""Barbara Ehrenreich""]",3.73,10027,1585.0,"Americans are a ""positive"" people—cheerful, optimistic, and upbeat: This is our reputation as well as our self-image. But more than a temperament, being positive, we are told, is the key to success and prosperity. 

In this utterly original take on the American frame of mind, Barbara Ehrenreich traces the strange career of our sunny outlook from its origins as a marginal nineteenth-century healing technique to its enshrinement as a dominant, almost mandatory, cultural attitude. Evangelical mega-churches preach the good news that you only have to want something to get it, because God wants to ""prosper"" you. The medical profession prescribes positive thinking for its presumed health benefits. Academia has made room for new departments of ""positive psychology"" and the ""science of happiness."" Nowhere, though, has bright-siding taken firmer root than within the business community, where, as Ehrenreich shows, the refusal even to consider negative outcomes—like mortgage defaults—contributed directly to the current economic crisis.

With the myth-busting powers for which she is acclaimed, Ehrenreich exposes the downside of America’s penchant for positive thinking: On a personal level, it leads to self-blame and a morbid preoccupation with stamping out “negative” thoughts. On a national level, it’s brought us an era of irrational optimism resulting in disaster. This is Ehrenreich at her provocative best—poking holes in conventional wisdom and faux science, and ending with a call for existential clarity and courage.","[""Nonfiction"",""Psychology"",""Sociology"",""Politics"",""Science"",""History"",""Philosophy"",""Self Help"",""Cultural"",""Social Science""]",10/13/2009,2009.0,"{""name"":""Barbara Ehrenreich"",""num_books"":96,""num_followers"":""1917""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":222,""reviews_percentage"":2},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":761,""reviews_percentage"":7},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":2834,""reviews_percentage"":28},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":3897,""reviews_percentage"":38},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":2313,""reviews_percentage"":23}}","""$11.99""",internal,external_focus,False

Amidst the Christmas revels of 1530, a fifteen-year-old girl arrived at the court of King Henry VIII. Half-English, half-Scottish, she was his niece, the Lady Margaret Douglas. For the next fifty years, Margaret held a unique and precarious position at the courts of Henry and his children. As the Protestant Reformations unfolded across the British Isles and the Tudor monarchs struggled to produce heirs, she had ambitions of her own. She wanted to see her family ruling a united, Catholic Britain. Through a Machiavellian combination of daring, spying, and luck, Margaret made her son into a suitor to her niece Mary, Queen of Scots. Together, they had a powerful claim to the English throne--so powerful that Queen Elizabeth I feared they would overthrow her and restore both England and Scotland to the Catholic faith. The marriage cost Margaret her position, her freedom, and her beloved son's life.

From the glittering Tudor court to the Tower of London, Lady Margaret Douglas weathered triumphs and tragedies in an era of tremendous change. Yet she never lost hope that she would see her family rule throughout the British Isles, which eventually happened when King James (I of England, VI of Scotland) united the crowns in 1603. Drawing on previously unexamined archival sources, So High a Blood presents a fascinating and dramatic portrait of this forgotten Tudor.","[""History"",""Biography"",""Nonfiction"",""Tudor Period"",""Historical"",""British Literature"",""Scotland""]",4/6/2017,2017.0,"{""name"":""Morgan Ring"",""num_books"":1,""num_followers"":""8""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":0,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":2,""reviews_percentage"":1},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":20,""reviews_percentage"":16},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":61,""reviews_percentage"":51},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":36,""reviews_percentage"":30}}","""$14.46""",external,external_focus,True

When a freak accident saw his father burn to death in front of him, Joe was left at the mercy of his mother. Without the love of his friend and brother, he wouldn't have survived. With them, he went on to spend his life fighting child abuse. 

Joe was just five years old and the horrific scene literally struck him dumb. He didn't speak for four and a half years, which meant he was unable to ask anyone for help as his life turned into a living hell. His schizophrenic mother and two of his older brothers spent the following years beating him, raping him and locking him in the cellar at the family home. 

Fed on scraps that he was forced to lick from the floor, he was sometimes left naked in the dark for three days without human contact. Unable to read or write, all Joe could do to communicate his suffering was draw pictures. The violence and sexual abuse grew in severity as more people, including his stepfather, were invited to use him in any way they chose. 

The only thing that saved Joe was the kindness of his elder brother and his only school friend, both of whom showed him that love was possible even in the darkest of situations. At fourteen he finally found the courage to run away, hiding in a hut by a railway line, fed on scraps by some local children who found him. 

Joe's is the ultimate insider's story, casting light into the darkest of hidden worlds, and a truly inspirational account of how one small boy found the strength to overcome almost impossible odds and become a remarkable man. Now that he has found his voice again, Joe speaks out against child abuse and helps support and protect other children whose lives have been blighted by it.","[""Nonfiction"",""Abuse"",""Memoir"",""Biography"",""Autobiography"",""True Crime"",""True Story"",""Crime"",""Drama"",""Psychology""]",1/1/2008,2008.0,"{""name"":""Joe Peters"",""num_books"":22,""num_followers"":""45""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":72,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":174,""reviews_percentage"":3},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":682,""reviews_percentage"":15},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1229,""reviews_percentage"":28},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":2195,""reviews_percentage"":50}}","""$12.99""",external,external_focus,True

The keen-eyed Nella Last shops assiduously at Barrow Market as austerity and rationing gradually give way to relative abundance; housewife Judy Haines, relishing the detail of suburban life, brings up her children in Chingford; the self-absorbed civil servant Henry St John perfects the art of grumbling. These and many other voices give a rich, unsentimental picture of everyday life in the 1950s. Well-known figures are encountered on the way, such as Doris Lessing (joining and later leaving the Communist Party), John Arlott (sticking up on Any Questions? for the rights of homosexuals) and Tiger 's Roy of the Rovers (making his goal-scoring debut for Melchester). All this is part of a colourful, unfolding tapestry, in which the great national events - the Tories returning to power, the death of George VI, the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth, the Suez Crisis - jostle alongside everything that gave Britain in the 1950s its distinctive  Butlin's holiday camps, Kenwood food mixers, Hancock's Half-Hour , Ekco television sets, Davy Crockett, skiffle and teddy boys.

It’s simple and straight to the point. My aim was to fill this book with value, no unnecessary words. Why say it in ten words when you can say it in one - Is the philosophy of the book. It’s short and direct, but what it lacks in length it makes up with in valuable content. Make sure your journal is to hand as I’m sure you’ll find a great idea. Time Is Your Most Precious Asset, Don’t Waste It “I don’t have the time!” is a complaint I here over and over again, plus it’s one I’ve used in the past. You have a great idea, but don’t have the time to develop it. What if, by introducing two rituals into your daily routine you could gain anything from 2 to 5 hours every day, would you have time then? This book will show you what those habits are and how to bring them into your life. Growth + Action = Success To achieve your goals and dream personal growth is needed. In order to grow we have to act outside our comfort zone. Comfort zones are a safe place, they’re only scary when we leave them. One half of the achievement is knowing you need to act outside your comfort zone, the other half is doing it. Not only will this book show you how to make it less scary, it also recommends further reading to help you overcome the fear. All We Have To Give Is Our Personal Service Zig Ziglar famously said “You can have everything in life you want if you help enough other people get what they want”. It’s a simple philosophy however, it’s often over looked. It’s easy to forget about people when we’re focused on building success. Having said that, if you take a look at the companies that change the world you’ll notice they have one thing in common. They enhance more lives. Find a way to serve as many people as possible and you will have everything you desire. Success Rituals will show you how we can all help at least one other person. About The Author I started my personal development journey at the age of 19 when I bought an un-profitable hair salon at over 3 times my salary. It was losing money fast, sink or swim. I chose to swim and devoured personal growth material. Since then I have studied over 200 books, 100’s of audio programs, countless videos and attended some fantastic seminars all with the intention of improving myself.

Tanks roaring over farmlands, pregnant mothers tortured, their babies stolen and sold on the black market, homes raided in the dead of night, ordinary citizens kidnapped and never seen again--such were the horrors of Argentina's Dirty War. Now, in A Lexicon of Terror, Marguerite Feitlowitz fully exposes the nightmare of sadism, paranoia, and deception the military dictatorship unleashed on the Argentine people, a nightmare that would claim over 30,000 civilians from 1976 to 1983 and whose leaders were recently issued warrants by a Spanish court for the crime of genocide.

Feitlowitz explores the perversion of language under state terrorism, both as it's used to conceal and confuse (""The Parliament must be disbanded to rejuvenate democracy"") and to domesticate torture and murder. Thus, citizens kidnapped and held in secret concentration camps were ""disappeared""; torture was referred to as ""intensive therapy""; prisoners thrown alive from airplanes over the ocean were called ""fish food."" Based on six years of research and moving interviews with peasants, intellectuals, activists, and bystanders, A Lexicon of Terror examines the full impact of this catastrophic period from its inception to the present, in which former torturers, having been pardoned and released from prison, live side by side with those they tortured.

Passionately written and impossible to put down, Feitlowitz shows us both the horror of the war and the heroism of those who resisted and survived--their courage, their endurance, their eloquent refusal to be dehumanized in the face of torments even Dante could not have imagined.","[""History"",""Nonfiction"",""Latin American History"",""Historical"",""Politics"",""School"",""Spanish Literature"",""Crime""]",4/16/1998,1998.0,"{""name"":""Marguerite Feitlowitz"",""num_books"":14,""num_followers"":""4""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":0,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":9,""reviews_percentage"":2},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":48,""reviews_percentage"":15},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":121,""reviews_percentage"":38},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":138,""reviews_percentage"":43}}","""$7.79""",external,external_focus,True

Joseph Campbell brought mythology to a mass audience. His bestselling books, including The Power of Myth and The Hero with a Thousand Faces, are the rare blockbusters that are also scholarly classics.While Campbell’s work reached wide and deep as he covered the world’s great mythological traditions, he never wrote a book on goddesses in world mythology. He did, however, have much to say on the subject. Between 1972 and 1986 he gave over twenty lectures and workshops on goddesses, exploring the figures, functions, symbols, and themes of the feminine divine, following them through their transformations across cultures and epochs.In this provocative volume, editor Safron Rossi—a goddess studies scholar, professor of mythology, and curator of collections at Opus Archives, which holds the Joseph Campbell archival manuscript collection and personal library—collects these lectures for the first time. In them, Campbell traces the evolution of the feminine divine from one Great Goddess to many, from Neolithic Old Europe to the Renaissance. He sheds new light on classical motifs and reveals how the feminine divine symbolizes the archetypal energies of transformation, initiation, and inspiration.","[""Mythology"",""Nonfiction"",""History"",""Feminism"",""Psychology"",""Spirituality"",""Philosophy"",""Religion"",""Goddess"",""Womens""]",12/10/2013,2013.0,"{""name"":""Joseph Campbell"",""num_books"":373,""num_followers"":""5492""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":46,""reviews_percentage"":3},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":34,""reviews_percentage"":2},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":171,""reviews_percentage"":12},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":425,""reviews_percentage"":30},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":723,""reviews_percentage"":51}}","""$9.99""",external,external_focus,False

Wat gebeurt er met gedeelde herinneringen als degene waar je die herinneringen mee deelde er niet meer is? Hoe kan het dat een collega wel uw idee heeft onthouden, maar vergeten is dat het úw idee was?

De lastigste vragen die je over het geheugen kunt stellen gaan niet over het herinneren maar over vergeten, schrijft Douwe Draaisma in Vergeetboek. Waarom bestaat er eigenlijk geen vergeettechniek? Waarom hebben portretten de neiging onze herinneringen aan gezichten te wissen? Wat gaat er mis in de hersenen van iemand die geen gezichten kan onthouden? 

In het denken over vergeten wordt zichtbaar wat we van onze herinneringen hopen of vrezen. De 'eerste herinnering' markeert niet alleen het begin van ons geheugen, maar onderstreept tegelijk de vergeten jaren die daaraan vooraf zijn gegaan. Ons goede geheugen voor 'eerste keren' herinnert ons ook aan al die keren die er op volgden en die we zijn vergeten. En zelfs mensen met een goed geheugen voor gezichten hebben een pover geheugen voor de geschiedenis van gezichten. Wie kan met de hand op zijn hart verklaren zich - los van foto's - te herinneren hoe zijn dierbaren er tien jaar geleden uitzagen? 

In Vergeetboek voert Draaisma de lezer langs de theorieën over waarom het geheugen pas zo laat op gang komt, de oorzaken voor het vergeten van dromen en de verklaring voor 'onbewust plagiaat'. Hij stelt ons voor aan Henry M., die door een geheugendefect leefde in een 'nu' ter breedte van een halve minuut en aan soldaat S. die zelfs zijn eigen gezicht niet kon onthouden.

Drawing on a wide range of historical and contemporary case studies,  Afghanistan; Cambodia, Cyprus; the Democratic Republic of Congo; East Timor; El Salvador; Haiti, Liberia; Rwanda; Sierra Leone; Somalia; and the former Yugoslavia, this book develops an original conceptual framework to chart the evolution of the role of peacekeeping in global politics, and highlights the unique characteristics of different types of peacekeeping operations. Part 1 examines concepts and issues related to peacekeeping in global politics. Part 2 charts the historical development of peacekeeping from 1945 to the present. In Part 3, separate chapters are devoted to different types of peacekeeping  traditional peacekeeping; managing transition; wider peacekeeping; peace enforcement; and peace support operations. Part 4 looks forward and examines developments in global politics that are presenting serious challenges to the concept and practice of peacekeeping, namely, globalization, the privatization of security, preventing violent conflict, and the establishment of protectorates.

Gabbard""]",4.32,319,15.0,"This new edition of the classic psychodynamic psychiatry text, Psychodynamic Psychiatry in Clinical Practice, continues its tradition as the most readable, scholarly, and practical introduction to psychodynamic theory and practice available. Kept within arm's reach of all mental health professionals, this invaluable ""one-stop"" reference will prepare you to teach students and treat patients more effectively with its truly integrative psychodynamic approach.

The author has meticulously updated every chapter of the previous edition, adding new illustrative case examples and discussing the most recent research findings and concepts in psychodynamic psychiatry. It introduces the basic principles of psychodynamic psychiatry and the four fundamental theoretical frameworks derived from psychoanalytic theory: ego psychology, object relations theory, self psychology, and attachment theory. Drawing on the latest breakthroughs in neuroscience to validate the latest psychodynamic thinking, the author includes neuroanatomical illustrations that highlight the need to integrate psychoanalytic theories of development with brain development and the impact of environment on gene expression.

The eminently practical Psychodynamic Psychiatry in Clinical Practice is organized into three distinct sections based on DSM-IV diagnoses: - Section I, Basic Principles and Treatment Approaches in Dynamic Psychiatry, begins by laying a foundation in psychoanalytic theory. It focuses on how to apply psychoanalytic theory to specific types of evaluation and treatment, including psychodynamic assessment, brief therapy, individual and group psychotherapy, family and marital therapy, pharmacotherapy, and hospital/partial hospital treatment.- Section II, Dynamic Approaches to Axis I Disorders, covers the major psychiatric disorders and discusses how to apply psychodynamic understanding to the treatment of patients with these disorders.- Section III, Dynamic Approaches to Axis II Disorders, provides a psychodynamic understanding of personality disorders and covers in detail the principles of psychodynamic psychotherapy for these conditions.

The fourth edition of Psychodynamic Psychiatry in Clinical Practice details the theory of psychodynamic psychotherapy and the adaptation of psychodynamic thinking to specific disorders. As such, it is an ideal companion to Dr. Gabbard's Long-Term Psychodynamic Psychotherapy: A Basic Text, which details the techniques of dynamic psychotherapy.

The bestselling Psychodynamic Psychiatry in Clinical Practice is the definitive reference for training programs of all kinds at all levels. This new edition provides a clear synthesis of diagnostic understanding and treatment unmatched in the literature. Marked by Dr. Gabbard's distinctly lucid and compelling prose, it is the ultimate psychiatric guide for the busy clinician and mental health student.","[""Psychology"",""Psychiatry"",""Psychoanalysis"",""Nonfiction"",""Mental Health"",""Academic"",""Reference""]",1/1/1990,1990.0,"{""name"":""Glen O.

His conclusions are sobering. Although most students make gains in many important respects, they improve much less than they should in such important areas as writing, critical thinking, quantitative skills, and moral reasoning. Large majorities of college seniors do not feel that they have made substantial progress in speaking a foreign language, acquiring cultural and aesthetic interests, or learning what they need to know to become active and informed citizens. Overall, despite their vastly increased resources, more powerful technology, and hundreds of new courses, colleges cannot be confident that students are learning more than they did fifty years ago.



Looking further, Bok finds that many important college courses are left to the least experienced teachers and that most professors continue to teach in ways that have proven to be less effective than other available methods. In reviewing their educational programs, however, faculties typically ignore this evidence. Instead, they spend most of their time discussing what courses to require, although the lasting impact of college will almost certainly depend much more on how the courses are taught.



In his final chapter, Bok describes the changes that faculties and academic leaders can make to help students accomplish more. Without ignoring the contributions that America's colleges have made, Bok delivers a powerful critique--one that educators will ignore at their peril.","[""Education"",""Nonfiction"",""History"",""Academic""]",1/1/2005,2005.0,"{""name"":""Derek Bok"",""num_books"":29,""num_followers"":""16""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":3,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":12,""reviews_percentage"":6},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":50,""reviews_percentage"":26},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":70,""reviews_percentage"":37},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":51,""reviews_percentage"":27}}","""$26.60""",external,external_focus,True

--David Remnick, TheNewYorker.com

On January 20, 2009, a few hundred men, women, and children gathered under trees in the twilight at K’obama, a village on the shores of Lake Victoria in western Kenya. Barack Obama’s rise to the American presidency had captivated people around the world, but members of this gathering took a special pride in the swearing in of America’s first black president, for they were all Obamas, all the president’s direct African family.
 
In the first in-depth history of the Obama family, Peter Firstbrook recounts a journey that starts in a mud hut by the White Nile and ends seven centuries later in the White House. Interweaving oral history and tribal lore, interviews with Obama family members and other Kenyans, the writings of Kenyan historians, and original genealogical research, Firstbrook sets the fascinating story of the president’s family against the background of Kenya’s rich culture and complex history.
 
He tells the story of farmers and fishermen, of healers and hunters, of families lost and found, establishing for the first time the early ancestry of the Obamas. From the tribe’s cradleland in southern Sudan, he follows the family generation by generation, tracing the paths of the famous Luo warriors—Obama’s direct ancestors—and vividly illuminating Luo politics, society, and traditions.
 
Firstbrook also brings to life the impact of English colonization in Africa through the eyes of President Obama’s grandfather Onyango. An ambitious and disciplined man who fought in two world wars, witnessed the bloody Mau Mau insurrection, and saw his country gain independence from white rule, Onyango was also hot-tempered and  family lore has it that President Obama’s grandmother abandoned the family after Onyango attempted to murder her.

Through recently discovered sermons, interviews with Robinson’s family and friends, and even an unpublished book by the player himself, Henry details a side of Jackie’s humanity that few have taken the time to see. Branch Rickey, the famed owner who risked it all by signing Jackie to his first contract, is also shown as a complex individual who wanted nothing more than to make his God-fearing mother proud of him. Few know the level at which Rickey struggled with his decision, only moving forward after a private meeting with a minister he’d just met. It turns out Rickey was not as certain about signing Robinson as historians have always assumed. With many baseball stories to enthrall even the most ardent enthusiast, 42 Faith also digs deep into why Jackie was the man he was and what both drove him and challenged him after his retirement. From his early years before baseball, to his time with Rickey and the Dodgers, to his failing health in his final years, we see a man of faith that few have recognized. This book will add a whole new dimension to Robinson’s already awe-inspiring legacy. Yes, Jackie and Branch are both still heroes long after their deaths.

Simpson, and Lee Harvey Oswald. Now, in the most controversial book of his celebrated career, he turns his incomparable prosecutorial eye on the greatest target of  God. In making his case for agnosticism, Bugliosi has very arguably written the most powerful indictment ever of God, organized religion, theism, and atheism. Theists will be left reeling by the commanding nature of Bugliosi’s extraordinary arguments against them. And, with his trademark incisive logic and devastating wit, he exposes the intellectual poverty of atheism and skewers its leading popularizers—Christopher Hitchens, Sam Harris, and Richard Dawkins. Joining a 2,000-year-old conversation which no one has contributed anything significant to for years, Bugliosi, in addition to destroying the all-important Christian argument of intelligent design, remarkably—yes, scarily—shakes the very foundations of Christianity by establishing that Jesus was not born of a virgin, and hence was not the son of God, that scripture in reality supports the notion of no free will, and that the immortality of the soul was a pure invention of Plato that Judaism and Christianity were forced to embrace because without it there is no life after death. Destined to be an all-time classic, Bugliosi’s Divinity of Doubt sets a new course amid the explosion of bestselling books on atheism and theism—the middle path of agnosticism.

The shocking murder of President William McKinley threw into stark relief the emerging new world order of what would come to be known as the American Century. The President and the Assassin is the story of the momentous years leading up to that event, and of the very different paths that brought together two of the most compelling figures of the era: President William McKinley and Leon Czolgosz, the anarchist who murdered him.The two men seemed to live in eerily parallel Americas. McKinley was to his contemporaries an enigma, a president whose conflicted feelings about imperialism reflected the country’s own. Under its popular Republican commander-in-chief, the United States was undergoing an uneasy transition from a simple agrarian society to an industrial powerhouse spreading its influence overseas by force of arms. Czolgosz was on the losing end of the economic changes taking place—a first-generation Polish immigrant and factory worker sickened by a government that seemed focused solely on making the rich richer. With a deft narrative hand, journalist Scott Miller chronicles how these two men, each pursuing what he considered the right and honorable path, collided in violence at the 1901 Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York.Along the way, readers meet a veritable who’s who of turn-of-the-century America: John Hay, McKinley’s visionary secretary of state, whose diplomatic efforts paved the way for a half century of Western exploitation of China; Emma Goldman, the radical anarchist whose incendiary rhetoric inspired Czolgosz to dare the unthinkable; and Theodore Roosevelt, the vainglorious vice president whose 1898 charge up San Juan Hill in Cuba is but one of many thrilling military adventures recounted here. Rich with relevance to our own era, The President and the Assassin holds a mirror up to a fascinating period of upheaval when the titans of industry grew fat, speculators sought fortune abroad, and desperate souls turned to terrorism in a vain attempt to thwart the juggernaut of change.","[""History"",""Nonfiction"",""Biography"",""Presidents"",""American History"",""Politics"",""True Crime"",""Us Presidents"",""Crime"",""Audiobook""]",6/14/2011,2011.0,"{""name"":""Scott  Miller"",""num_books"":3,""num_followers"":""49""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":73,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":186,""reviews_percentage"":4},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1005,""reviews_percentage"":22},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1917,""reviews_percentage"":42},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1345,""reviews_percentage"":29}}","""$14.99""",external,external_focus,True

This image is so prevalent in painting, literature, film, and, most recently, in mass media, that we rarely question what is at stake in its representation. Tatar, however, challenges us to consider what is taking place-both artistically and socially-in the construction and circulation of scenes depicting sexual murder. In examining images of sexual murder (Lustmord), she produces a riveting study of how art and murder have intersected in the sexual politics of culture from Weimar Germany to the present. Tatar focuses attention on the politically turbulent Weimar Republic, often viewed as the birthplace of a transgressive avant-garde modernism, where representations of female sexual mutilation abound. Here a revealing episode in the gender politics of cultural production unfolds as male artists and writers, working in a society consumed by fear of outside threats, envision women as enemies that can be contained and mastered through transcendent artistic expression. Not only does Tatar show that male artists openly identified with real-life sexual murderers-George Grosz posed as Jack the Ripper in a photograph where his model and future wife was the target of his knife-but she also reveals the ways in which victims were disavowed and erased. Tatar first analyzes actual cases of sexual murder that aroused wide public interest in Weimar Germany. She then considers how the representation of murdered women in visual and literary works functions as a strategy for managing social andsexual anxieties, and shows how violence against women can be linked to the war trauma, to urban pathologies, and to the politics of cultural production and biological reproduction. In exploring the complex relationship between victim and agent in cases of sexual murder, Tatar explains how the roles came to be destabilized and reversed, turning the perpetrator of criminal deeds into a defenseless victim of seductive evil. Throughout the West today, the creation of similar ideological constructions still occurs in societies that have only recently begun to validate the voices of its victims. Maria Tatar's book opens up an important discussion for readers seeking to understand the forces behind sexual violence and its portrayal in the cultural media throughout this century.","[""History"",""Nonfiction"",""Art"",""Germany"",""Crime"",""Feminism"",""Art History""]",1/1/1995,1995.0,"{""name"":""Maria Tatar"",""num_books"":49,""num_followers"":""287""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":2,""reviews_percentage"":2},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":9,""reviews_percentage"":10},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":19,""reviews_percentage"":22},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":30,""reviews_percentage"":35},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":25,""reviews_percentage"":29}}","""$31.99""",external,external_focus,True

This book integrates new archival material with the findings of recent scholarship to present the reader with a comprehensive and general history of the origins and consequences of the 1948 war. The author shows, in sharp contrast to the recollections and myths of both sides, that the military events of 1948 were not decisive. The victory of the Zionist organization and the fate of the Palestinians was determined by politicians on both sides - in the discussions and decisions of the United Nations in 1947-8 and in the Arab League - long before a shot had been fired.

Over the past two years, she has transformed almost every aspect of her life. She has quit smoking, run a marathon, and been promoted at work. The patterns inside her brain, neurologists discover, have fundamentally changed.

Marketers at Procter & Gamble study videos of people making their beds. They are desperately trying to figure out how to sell a new product called Febreze, on track to be one of the biggest flops in company history. Suddenly, one of them detects a nearly imperceptible pattern—and with a slight shift in advertising, Febreze goes on to earn a billion dollars a year.

An untested CEO takes over one of the largest companies in America. His first order of business is attacking a single pattern among his employees—how they approach worker safety—and soon the firm, Alcoa, becomes the top performer in the Dow Jones.

What do all these people have in common? They achieved success by focusing on the patterns that shape every aspect of our lives.

They succeeded by transforming habits.

In The Power of Habit, award-winning New York Times business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed. With penetrating intelligence and an ability to distill vast amounts of information into engrossing narratives, Duhigg brings to life a whole new understanding of human nature and its potential for transformation.

Along the way we learn why some people and companies struggle to change, despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight. We visit laboratories where neuroscientists explore how habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. We discover how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr. We go inside Procter & Gamble, Target superstores, Rick Warren’s Saddleback Church, NFL locker rooms, and the nation’s largest hospitals and see how implementing so-called keystone habits can earn billions and mean the difference between failure and success, life and death.

At its core, The Power of Habit contains an exhilarating argument: The key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive, building revolutionary companies and social movements, and achieving success is understanding how habits work.

Habits aren’t destiny.

Quando si incontrano e si innamorano, decidono di condividere tutto: leggono e studiano insieme, insieme discutono di politica, viaggiano, ridono, lottano.

Livia muore con i loro migliori amici, Clem e Alberto, anche loro insegnanti, anche loro giovani impegnati in politica. Perdono la vita altre cinque persone, «non vittime, ma caduti consapevoli» che quella mattina di pioggia si ritrovano in piazza per il loro impegno antifascista. Da quel giorno, per Manlio Milani inizia una seconda vita tra aule di tribunali, aspettando una giustizia che non è mai arrivata, collezionando frammenti di una verità sempre incompleta.

Di paura e speranze. E quando trentasei anni dopo ascolta con Manlio l'ennesima sentenza di assoluzione: «Tutti assolti per non aver commesso il fatto», capisce cosa vuol dire provare rabbia e impotenza verso chi ha nascosto e manipolato la verità. Con sguardo lucido e partecipe, l'autrice compie un viaggio nei misteri recenti della storia italiana, rivisitando il capitolo rimosso della violenza neofascista, pronta, ancora una volta, a cercare di capire cosa furono quegli anni e a fare in modo che una strage non si riduca semplicemente a un luogo e una cifra: il numero dei morti. Una strage è l'incontro con il male.

Their mission was to capture or kill a notorious al Qaeda leader known to be ensconced in a Taliban stronghold surrounded by a small but heavily armed force. Less then twenty-four hours later, only one of those Navy SEALs remained alive.  This is the story of fire team leader Marcus Luttrell, the sole survivor of Operation Redwing, and the desperate battle in the mountains that led, ultimately, to the largest loss of life in Navy SEAL history. But it is also, more than anything, the story of his teammates, who fought ferociously beside him until he was the last one left-blasted unconscious by a rocket grenade, blown over a cliff, but still armed and still breathing. Over the next four days, badly injured and presumed dead, Luttrell fought off six al Qaeda assassins who were sent to finish him, then crawled for seven miles through the mountains before he was taken in by a Pashtun tribe, who risked everything to protect him from the encircling Taliban killers. A six-foot-five-inch Texan, Leading Petty Officer Luttrell takes us, blow-by-blow, through the brutal training of America's warrior elite and the relentless rites of passage required by the Navy SEALs. He transports us to a monstrous battle fought in the desolate peaks of Afghanistan, where the beleaguered American team plummeted headlong a thousand feet down a mountain as they fought back through flying shale and rocks.

Through compelling research and company examples, including DaimlerChrysler, McKinsey & Company, Shell, and the World Bank, authors Etienne Wenger, Richard McDermott, and William M.

War of the Whales is the gripping tale of a crusading attorney who stumbles on one of the US Navy’s best-kept secrets: a submarine detection system that floods entire ocean basins with high-intensity sound—and drives whales onto beaches. As Joel Reynolds launches a legal fight to expose and challenge the Navy program, marine biologist Ken Balcomb witnesses a mysterious mass stranding of whales near his research station in the Bahamas. Investigating this calamity, Balcomb is forced to choose between his conscience and an oath of secrecy he swore to the Navy in his youth.

When Balcomb and Reynolds team up to expose the truth behind an epidemic of mass strandings, the stage is set for an epic battle that pits admirals against activists, rogue submarines against weaponized dolphins, and national security against the need to safeguard the ocean environment.

But for all the heat of claim and counter-claim, the argument is essentially beside the point: it’s here; it’s everywhere. The real question is, do we direct technology, or do we let ourselves be directed by it and those who have mastered it? “Choose the former,” writes Rushkoff, “and you gain access to the control panel of civilization. Choose the latter, and it could be the last real choice you get to make.” In ten chapters, composed of ten “commands” accompanied by original illustrations from comic artist Leland Purvis, Rushkoff provides cyberenthusiasts and technophobes alike with the guidelines to navigate this new universe.

In this spirited, accessible poetics of new media, Rushkoff picks up where Marshall McLuhan left off, helping readers come to recognize programming as the new literacy of the digital age––and as a template through which to see beyond social conventions and power structures that have vexed us for centuries. This is a friendly little book with a big and actionable message.

He is a familiar voice on NPR, face on PBS, and writer in publications from Discover Magazine to the New York Times.

A deeply affecting, funny, insightful meditation that challenges readers to find the spiritual meaning of parenting.

Every day, parents are bombarded by demands. The pressures of work and life are relentless; our children’s needs are often impossible to meet; and we rarely, if ever, allow ourselves the time and attention necessary to satisfy our own inner longings. Parenthood is difficult, demanding, and draining. And yet, argues Rabbi Danya Ruttenberg, if we can approach it from a different mindset, perhaps the work of parenting itself can offer the solace we seek.

Rooted in Judaism but incorporating a wide-range of religious and literary traditions, Nurture the Wow asks, Can ancient ideas about relationships, drudgery, pain, devotion, and purpose help make the hard parts of a parent’s job easier and the magical stuff even more so? Ruttenberg shows how parenting can be considered a spiritual practice―and how seeing it that way can lead to transformation. This is a parent hood book, not a parent ing book; it shows how the experiences we have as parents can change us for the better.

Enlightening, uplifting, and laugh-out-loud funny, Nurture the Wow reveals how parenthood―in all its crazy-making, rage-inducing, awe and joy-filled moments―can actually be the path to living fully, authentically, and soulfully.","[""Parenting"",""Nonfiction"",""Judaism"",""Jewish"",""Self Help"",""Spirituality"",""Religion""]",4/19/2016,2016.0,"{""name"":""Danya Ruttenberg"",""num_books"":15,""num_followers"":""245""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":2,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":9,""reviews_percentage"":3},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":39,""reviews_percentage"":15},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":94,""reviews_percentage"":37},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":108,""reviews_percentage"":42}}","""$11.99""",internal,internal_focus,False

Geography has always been important, though it has had only a short history as an academic discipline and is much misunderstood. Modern Geography has come a long way from its historical roots in exploring foreign lands, in mapping the world and in describing the physical and human features of the Earth's surface. There are two parts to the  Physical Geography, which covers natural environments and landscapes; and Human Geography, which investigates people and the cultural landscape. Physical and human geographers commonly do not agree with each other. But there are also common elements and Geography as a whole has an important role as a bridge between the sciences and the humanities. Using wide-ranging examples, the book paints a broad picture of the current state of Geography, its subject

Ayala Fader examines language, gender, and the body from infancy to adulthood, showing how Hasidic girls in Brooklyn become women responsible for rearing the next generation of nonliberal Jewish believers. To uncover how girls learn the practices of Hasidic Judaism, Fader looks beyond the synagogue to everyday talk in the context of homes, classrooms, and city streets.

Hasidic women complicate stereotypes of nonliberal religious women by collapsing distinctions between the religious and the secular. In this innovative book, Fader demonstrates that contemporary Hasidic femininity requires women and girls to engage with the secular world around them, protecting Hasidic men and boys who study the Torah. Even as Hasidic religious observance has become more stringent, Hasidic girls have unexpectedly become more fluent in secular modernity. They are fluent Yiddish speakers but switch to English as they grow older; they are increasingly modest but also fashionable; they read fiction and play games like those of mainstream American children but theirs have Orthodox Jewish messages; and they attend private Hasidic schools that freely adapt from North American public and parochial models. Investigating how Hasidic women and girls conceptualize the religious, the secular, and the modern, Mitzvah Girls offers exciting new insights into cultural production and change in nonliberal religious communities.","[""Jewish"",""Judaism"",""Nonfiction"",""Religion"",""Anthropology"",""Sociology"",""Gender"",""Ethnography"",""Academic"",""Linguistics""]",1/1/2009,2009.0,"{""name"":""Ayala Fader"",""num_books"":2,""num_followers"":""5""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":10,""reviews_percentage"":4},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":59,""reviews_percentage"":26},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":103,""reviews_percentage"":46},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":48,""reviews_percentage"":21}}","""$25.99""",external,external_focus,True

It was where she learned to swim and ride a bike, first kissed a boy, became a writer, and, during twenty-eight summers, raised her own daughter. In Finding Martha?s Vineyard, Nelson offers a lively, intimate portrait of a place that has provided respite and rejuvenation, community and contemplation for generations of African Americans. Part memoir, part history, Finding Martha?s Vineyard describes the various groups that settled on the Vineyard and in Oak Bluffs; slaves and their descendants; devout Methodists and Baptists; African Americans ?in service? who accompanied their white employers to the island and over the years established a haven and a community; the black middle-class families who came each summer to escape the heat, hostility, and racial tension of their hometowns; and generations of African American professionals?doctors, presidential advisors, writers, academics and artists?who visit or live on the Vineyard today. Nelson interviews the Cottagers, the proud owners of Oak Bluffs? famous Gingerbread cottages; members of the Polar Bear Club, a die-hard group that swims together every summer morning at 7:30 A.M.; and such famous residents as Vernon Jordan, Bebe Moore Campbell, and Stephen Carter.Finding Martha?s Vineyard is about the power of place in our lives.

The dog doesn’t respond to its owner based on what the owner thinks, says, or does; it responds to what the owner feels. And in this way, dogs can actually put people back in touch with their own emotions.Behan was originally trained under the dominance theory by his father, John Behan, one of the first in America to make dog training a career. But he eventually came to believe that what made the modern dog trainable was not the dominance hierarchy but the dog’s ability to work as a cooperative group member in the hunt. This ability then evolved into an emotional capacity that perfectly complements human emotion.Behan demonstrates that dogs and humans are connected more profoundly than has ever been imagined — by heart — and that this approach to dog cognition can help us understand many of dogs’ most inscrutable behaviors.

This groundbreaking new work, from the editor of the highly regarded Cambridge World History of Food, examines the exploding global palate. It begins with the transition from foraging to farming that got underway some 10,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent, then examines subsequent transitions in Egypt, Africa south of the Sahara, China, southeast Asia, the Indus Valley Oceanic, Europe, and the Americas. It ends with chapters on genetically modified foods, the fast food industry, the nutritional ailments people have suffered from, famine, the obesity epidemic, and a look at the future on the food front. Food, at its most basic, fuels the human body. At its most refined, food has been elevated to a position of fine art. The path food has taken through history is a fairly straightforward one; the space which it occupies today could not be more fraught.

But ""the West"" is the more dangerous mirage of our own time, Ian Buruma and Avishai Margalit argue, and the idea of ""the West"" in the minds of its self-proclaimed enemies remains largely unexamined and woefully misunderstood. Occidentalism is their groundbreaking investigation of the demonizing fantasies and stereotypes about the Western world that fuel such hatred in the hearts of others.

We generally understand ""radical Islam"" as a purely Islamic phenomenon, but Buruma and Margalit show that while the Islamic part of radical Islam certainly is, the radical part owes a primary debt of inheritance to the West. Whatever else they are, al Qaeda and its ilk are revolutionary anti-Western political movements, and Buruma and Margalit show us that the bogeyman of the West who stalks their thinking is the same one who has haunted the thoughts of many other revolutionary groups, going back to the early nineteenth century. In this genealogy of the components of the anti-Western worldview, the same oppositions appear again and again: the heroic revolutionary versus the timid, soft bourgeois; the rootless, deracinated cosmopolitan living in the Western city, cut off from the roots of a spiritually healthy society; the sterile Western mind, all reason and no soul; the machine society, controlled from the center by a cabal of insiders—often Jews—pulling the hidden levers of power versus an organically knit-together one, a society of ""blood and soil.""

Jackson""]",4.32,218,17.0,"Sherman Jackson offers a trenchant examination of the career of Islam among the blacks of America. Jackson notes that no one has offered a convincing explanation of why Islam spread among Blackamericans (a coinage he explains and defends) but not among white Americans or Hispanics. The assumption has been that there is an African connection. In fact, Jackson shows, none of the distinctive features of African Islam appear in the proto-Islamic, black nationalist movements of the early 20th century. Instead, he argues, Islam owes its momentum to the distinctively American phenomenon of ""Black Religion,"" a God-centered holy protest against anti-black racism.
Islam in Black America begins as part of a communal search for tools with which to combat racism and redefine American blackness. The 1965 repeal of the National Origins Quota System led to a massive influx of foreign Muslims, who soon greatly outnumbered the blacks whom they found here practicing an indigenous form of Islam. Immigrant Muslims would come to exercise a virtual monopoly over the definition of a properly constituted Islamic life in America. For these Muslims, the nemesis was not white supremacy, but ""the West."" In their eyes, the West was not a racial, but a religious and civilizational threat. American blacks soon learned that opposition to the West and opposition to white supremacy were not synonymous. Indeed, says Jackson, one cannot be anti-Western without also being on some level anti-Blackamerican. Like the Black Christians of an earlier era struggling to find their voice in the context of Western Christianity, Black Muslims now began to strive to find their black,
American voice in the context of the super-tradition of historical Islam. Jackson argues that Muslim tradition itself contains the resources to reconcile blackness, American-ness, and adherence to Islam. It is essential, he contends, to preserve within Islam the legitimate aspects of Black Religion, in order to avoid what Stephen Carter calls the domestication of religion, whereby religion is rendered incapable of resisting the state and the dominant culture. At the same time, Jackson says, it is essential for Blackamerican Muslims to reject an exclusive focus on the public square and the secular goal of subverting white supremacy (and Arab/immigrant supremacy) and to develop a tradition of personal piety and spirituality attuned to distinctive Blackamerican needs and idiosyncrasies.","[""Islam"",""Religion"",""History"",""Nonfiction"",""Theology"",""Cultural Studies"",""Race"",""American"",""African American""]",1/1/2005,2005.0,"{""name"":""Sherman A.

Here is a fascinating expedition into this ancient tradition, from its prehistoric beginnings to the work of women shamans across the globe today.

Shamanism was not only humankind’s first spiritual and healing practice, it was originally the domain of women. This is the claim of Barbara Tedlock’s provocative and myth-shattering book. Reinterpreting generations of scholarship, Tedlock–herself an expert in dreamwork, divination, and healing–explains how and why the role of women in shamanism was misinterpreted and suppressed, and offers a dazzling array of evidence, from prehistoric African rock art to modern Mongolian ceremonies, for women’s shamanic powers.

Tedlock combines firsthand accounts of her own training among the Maya of Guatemala with the rich record of women warriors and hunters, spiritual guides, and prophets from many cultures and times. Probing the practices that distinguish female shamanism from the much better known male traditions, she reveals:

• The key role of body wisdom and women’s eroticism in shamanic trance and ecstasy

• The female forms of dream witnessing, vision questing, and use of hallucinogenic drugs

• Shamanic midwifery and the spiritual powers released in childbirth and monthly female cycles

• Shamanic symbolism in weaving and other feminine arts

• Gender shifting and male-female partnership in shamanic practice

Filled with illuminating stories and illustrations, The Woman in the Shaman’s Body restores women to their essential place in the history of spirituality and celebrates their continuing role in the worldwide resurgence of shamanism today.","[""Spirituality"",""Nonfiction"",""History"",""Feminism"",""Anthropology"",""Womens"",""Paganism"",""Womens Studies"",""Health"",""Gender""]",1/1/2000,2000.0,"{""name"":""Barbara Tedlock"",""num_books"":11,""num_followers"":""9""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":4,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":13,""reviews_percentage"":4},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":56,""reviews_percentage"":18},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":103,""reviews_percentage"":33},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":134,""reviews_percentage"":43}}","""$10.99""",external,internal_focus,True

We develop new means of overcoming obstacles; we are, therefore, neither prisoners of our environment nor victims of our past.

In Dr. Kelly's groundbreaking theory, the patterns of our make-up, which he calls constructs, are the key to changing old patters. Each person anticipates events differently, and Dr. Kelly shows how we can begin to understand each person's unique constructs. In this way, a person is enabled to create alternative constructions―finding a sense of meaning in life, regaining control over his or her environment, and establishing new roads to mental health.

A searing family memoir of a tempestuous Texas boyhood that led to the vicious murder of the author’s brother As William Faulkner said, “The past is not dead, it’s not even past.” This observation seems especially true in matters of family, when the fury between generations is often never resolved and instead secretly carried, a wound that cannot heal. For David Berg, this is truer than for most, and once you read the story of his family, you will understand why he held it privately for so long and why the betrayals between parent and child can be the most wrenching of all.

In 1968 David Berg’s brother, Alan, was murdered by Charles Harrelson, a notorious hit man and father of actor Woody Harrelson. Alan was only thirty-one when he disappeared; six months later his remains were found in a ditch in Texas. Run, Brother, Run is Berg’s story of the murder. But it is also his account of the psychic destruction of the Berg family by the author’s father, who allowed a grievous blunder at the age of twenty-three to define his life. The event changed the fate of a clan and fell most heavily on Alan, the firstborn son, who tried to both redeem and escape his father yet could not.

This achingly painful family history is also a portrait of an iconic American place, playing out in the shady bars of Houston, in small-town law offices and courtrooms, and in remote ranch lands where bad things happen—a true-crime murder drama, all perfectly calibrated. Writing with cold-eyed grief and a wild, lacerating humor, Berg tells us first about the striving Jewish family that created Alan Berg and set him on a course for self-destruction and then about the gross miscarriage of justice that followed.

As with the best and most powerfully written memoirs, the author has kept this horrific story to himself for a long time. A scrappy and pugnacious narrator, Berg takes his account into the darkest human  the epic battles between father and son, marital destruction, reckless gambling, crooked legal practices, extortion, and, of course, cold-blooded murder. Run, Brother, Run is a raw, furious, bawdy, and scathing testimonial about love, hate, and pain— and utterly unforgettable.","[""True Crime"",""Memoir"",""Nonfiction"",""Crime"",""Biography"",""History"",""Law"",""Death""]",6/11/2013,2013.0,"{""name"":""David Berg"",""num_books"":50,""num_followers"":""5""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":15,""reviews_percentage"":2},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":69,""reviews_percentage"":10},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":235,""reviews_percentage"":36},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":214,""reviews_percentage"":33},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":108,""reviews_percentage"":16}}","""$14.99""",external,external_focus,True

But her second time around was radically different: assigned to a men's jail, her return coincided with the dawn of ""stop-and-frisk"" policy, unprecedented arrests, and the biggest jailhouse movement in history.

Committed to the possibility of growth for her charges, Buser tried to keep the new regime at bay-yet soon her patients began arriving to their sessions with bruises, black eyes, and punched-out teeth, whispering that they'd been beaten by officers. And-because of the anxiety surrounding their respective legal cases and the sheer impossibility of their release-they refused to report it. As she was transferred between different jails, including the Mental Health Center and the dreaded ""solitary,"" she saw horrors she'd never imagined. Finally, it became too much to bear, and Buser escaped Rikers and never looked back-until now.

While this is true, it is only part of the story. As a student at Oxford University, he experienced a spiritual awakening under the influence of John Wesley's Methodists and immediately began tending to prisoners, caring for the poor, and preaching the Christian gospel. He met with astounding success, in time speaking to larger crowds than had ever gathered in the history of England. Whitefield became the most famous man of his age.  His impact upon the American colonies, however, may have been his most lasting gift. In seven tours of the colonies, Whitfield preached from Georgia to Maine, calling the colonists to spiritual conversion and challenging them in their sense of national destiny. He befriended men like Benjamin Franklin, converted men like Patrick Henry, and inspired men like George Washington. Furthermore, when he learned that England intended to tighten her control over the colonies, Whitefield warmed his American friends in sermon after sermon and even accompanied Benjamin Franklin to make the American case in the Court of Saint James. Many of the colonists considered him the father of their revolution.  Forgotten Founding Father  captures the early struggles and international successes of this amazing leader. The result is a portrait of a gifted but flawed human who yielded himself as a tool in the hands of a sovereign God. Also portrayed is how important Whitfield was to the American cause and how much Americans today owe to him -- a story that will inspire a new generation with a past vividly and truthfully retold.","[""Biography"",""History"",""Nonfiction"",""Christian"",""American History""]",4/30/2001,2001.0,"{""name"":""Stephen Mansfield"",""num_books"":80,""num_followers"":""149""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":2,""reviews_percentage"":3},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":4,""reviews_percentage"":7},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":5,""reviews_percentage"":9},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":19,""reviews_percentage"":35},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":24,""reviews_percentage"":44}}","""$7.99""",external,external_focus,True

Tobin""]",3.5,113,25.0,"This extraordinary narrative offers a fresh perspective on the Underground Railroad as it traces the perilous journeys of fugitive ex–slaves from the United States to free black settlements in Canada.

The Underground Railroad was the passage to freedom for many slaves, but it was rife with dangers. There were dedicated conductors and safe houses, but also arduous nights in the mountains and days in threatening towns. For those who made it to Midnight (the code name given to Detroit), the Detroit River became a River Jordan—and Canada became their land of Canaan, the Promised Land where they could live freely in black settlements under the protection of British law. One of these settlements was known as Dawn.

In prose rich in detail and imagery, From Midnight to Dawn presents compelling portraits of the men and women who established the Railroad, and of the people who traveled it to find new lives in Canada. Some of the figures are well known, like Harriet Tubman and John Brown. But there are equally heroic, less familiar figures here as well, like Mary Ann Shadd, who became the first black female newspaper editor in North America, and Osborne Perry Anderson, the only black survivor of the fighting at Harpers Ferry.

From Midnight to Dawn evokes the turmoil and controversies of the time, reveals the compelling stories behind events such as Harpers Ferry and the Christian Resistance, and introduces the reader to the real–life “Uncle Tom” who influenced Harriet Beecher Stowe’s Uncle Tom ’ s Cabin .

An extraordinary examination of a part of American history that transcends national borders, From Midnight to Dawn will captivate readers with its tales of hope, courage, and a people’s determination to live equal under the law.","[""History"",""Nonfiction"",""American History"",""Race"",""Civil War"",""Audiobook""]",1/16/2007,2007.0,"{""name"":""Jacqueline L.

Emerging from the continental rivalries of European empires and their native allies, the revolution pivoted on western expansion as well as seaboard resistance to British taxes. When war erupted, Patriot crowds harassed Loyalists and nonpartisans into compliance with their cause. The war exploded in set battles like Saratoga and Yorktown and spread through continuing frontier violence.

The discord smoldering within the fragile new nation called forth a movement to concentrate power through a Federal Constitution.

Crockett Johnson (born David Johnson Leisk, 1906-1975) and Ruth Krauss (1901- 1993) were a husband-and-wife team that created such popular children's books as The Carrot Seed and How to Make an Earthquake. Separately, Johnson created the enduring children's classic Harold and the Purple Crayon and the groundbreaking comic strip Barnaby. Krauss wrote over a dozen children's books illustrated by others and pioneered the use of spontaneous, loose-tongued kids in children's literature. Together, Johnson and Krauss's style--whimsical writing, clear and minimalist drawing, and a child's point of view--is among the most revered and influential in children's literature and cartooning, inspiring the work of Maurice Sendak, Charles M. Schulz, Chris Van Allsburg, and Jon Scieszka.
This critical biography examines their lives and careers, including their separate achievements when not collaborating. Using correspondence, sketches, contemporary newspaper and magazine accounts, archived and personal interviews, author Philip Nel draws a compelling portrait of a couple whose output encompassed children's literature, comics, graphic design, and the fine arts. Their mentorship of now famous illustrator Maurice Sendak (Where the Wild Things Are) is examined at length, as is the couple's appeal to adult contemporaries such as Duke Ellington and Dorothy Parker. Defiantly leftist in an era of McCarthyism and Cold War paranoia, Johnson and Krauss risked collaborations that often contained subtly rendered liberal themes. Indeed, they were under FBI surveillance for years. Their legacy of considerable success invites readers to dream and to imagine, drawing paths that take them anywhere they want to go.","[""Biography"",""Nonfiction"",""Art"",""Comics"",""History"",""Books About Books"",""Writing"",""Adult"",""Biography Memoir""]",1/1/2012,2012.0,"{""name"":""Philip Nel"",""num_books"":23,""num_followers"":""42""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":3,""reviews_percentage"":3},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":4,""reviews_percentage"":5},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":15,""reviews_percentage"":19},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":43,""reviews_percentage"":55},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":12,""reviews_percentage"":15}}","""$25.00""",external,external_focus,False

In this second volume of The “Unknown” Reality , Seth radically expands our conceptions of “self,” by showing us that the human personality is literally infinite in its scope and potential. He discloses precisely how probable realities combine to create our waking lives, and how our “higher selves” make decisions regarding our everyday existence.

In a far-reaching exploration of the dynamics of desire and free will, he asserts that each atom, molecule, and cell has its own consciousness and powers of choice. With humor and simple analogies, Seth leads us beyond our ordinary level of awareness into a spectacular discovery of the multidimensional nature of the self, 

•  “Consciousness units” as the basis of our universe
•  The relevance of extrasensory perception in understanding our world
•  The worlds we visit in dreams and out-of-body states
•  Dreaming as a science to create present and future realities
•  “Families of consciousness” we choose to belong to
•  Practical methods for exploring your own “unknown” reality

“There is an “unknown” reality. I am part of it, and so are you . . . Each individual is a part of the unknown reality . . . To explore the unknown reality you must venture within your own psyche, travel inward through invisible roads as you journey outward on physical ones . . . I hope that [in this book] the reader can see the greater dimensions that touch ordinary living, and sense the psyche’s greater magic.”     — Jane Roberts, Speaking for Seth","[""Spirituality"",""Metaphysics"",""Nonfiction"",""New Age"",""Self Help"",""Philosophy"",""Occult""]",3/1/1979,1979.0,"{""name"":""Jane Roberts"",""num_books"":240,""num_followers"":""356""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":7,""reviews_percentage"":1},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":57,""reviews_percentage"":10},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":125,""reviews_percentage"":22},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":354,""reviews_percentage"":65}}","""$9.99""",internal,internal_focus,False

Grant (1822-1885) was one of the most esteemed individuals of the nineteenth century. His two-volume memoirs, sold door-to-door by former Union soldiers, have never gone out of print and were once as ubiquitous in American households as the Bible. Mark Twain, Gertrude Stein, Matthew Arnold, Henry James, and Edmund Wilson hailed these works as great literature, and Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush both credit Grant with influencing their own writing. Yet a judiciously annotated clarifying edition of these memoirs has never been produced until now.

The Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant is the first comprehensively annotated edition of Grant's memoirs, fully representing the great military leader's thoughts on his life and times through the end of the Civil War and his invaluable perspective on battlefield decision making. An introduction contextualizes Grant's life and significance, and lucid editorial commentary allows the president's voice and narrative to shine through. With annotations compiled by the editors of the Ulysses S. Grant Association's Presidential Library, this definitive edition enriches our understanding of the antebellum era, the Mexican War, and the Civil War. Grant provides insight into how rigorously these events tested America's democratic institutions and the cohesion of its social order.

The Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant preserves and extends a work of profound political, historical, and literary significance and serves as the gateway for modern readers of all backgrounds to an American classic.","[""History"",""Biography"",""Nonfiction"",""Civil War"",""Memoir"",""American History"",""Presidents"",""Autobiography"",""War"",""American Civil War""]",1/1/1885,1885.0,"{""name"":""Ulysses S.

Africa's legendary City of Gold, not visited by Europeans since the Middle Ages, held the promise of wealth and fame for the first explorer to make it there. In 1824, the French Geographical Society offered a cash prize to the first expedition from any nation to visit Timbuktu and return to tell the tale.

One of the contenders was Major Alexander Gordon Laing, a thirty–year–old army officer. Handsome and confident, Laing was convinced that Timbuktu was his destiny, and his ticket to glory. In July 1825, after a whirlwind romance with Emma Warrington, daughter of the British consul at Tripoli, Laing left the Mediterranean coast to cross the Sahara. His 2,000–mile journey took on an added urgency when Hugh Clapperton, a more experienced explorer, set out to beat him. Apprised of each other's mission by overseers in London who hoped the two would cooperate, Clapperton instead became Laing's rival, spurring him on across a hostile wilderness.

A little over a century ago, a young Albert Einstein presented his general theory of relativity to the world and utterly transformed our understanding of the universe. He overturned centuries of thinking about gravity by revealing how it arises from the curvature of space and time. Yet general relativity has had far greater consequences. It has revealed that our universe has been expanding from a hot dense state called the big bang. It has changed our understanding of space and time. And it predicts that the universe is an extreme place, containing black holes and possibly wormholes.

Using Einstein's insights, today's cosmologists have come to realize that most of the universe is missing in the form of mysterious dark matter and dark energy.

In Where The Universe Came From leading cosmologists and New Scientist explain that while we have made great progress, we still have plenty of unfinished business with the cosmos. How does the dark universe shape our cosmic destiny? What is really happening near black holes? Are we any closer to discovering the ripples in space-time predicted by Einstein? Why is relativity not the final answer?

In the wake of this violence, a vibrant pan-Mayan movement has emerged, one that is challenging Ladino (non-indigenous) notions of citizenship and national identity. In The Blood of Guatemala Greg Grandin locates the origins of this ethnic resurgence within the social processes of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century state formation rather than in the ruins of the national project of recent decades.
	Focusing on Mayan elites in the community of Quetzaltenango, Grandin shows how their efforts to maintain authority over the indigenous population and secure political power in relation to non-Indians played a crucial role in the formation of the Guatemalan nation. To explore the close connection between nationalism, state power, ethnic identity, and political violence, Grandin draws on sources as diverse as photographs, public rituals, oral testimony, literature, and a collection of previously untapped documents written during the nineteenth century. He explains how the cultural anxiety brought about by Guatemala’s transition to coffee capitalism during this period led Mayan patriarchs to develop understandings of race and nation that were contrary to Ladino notions of assimilation and progress. This alternative national vision, however, could not take hold in a country plagued by class and ethnic divisions. In the years prior to the 1954 coup, class conflict became impossible to contain as the elites violently opposed land claims made by indigenous peasants.

Born almost blind, Schneider taught himself to see and developed an innovative program of healing and recovery that has helped thousands of people regain and improve their health.

Vision for Life is packed with exercises for a natural eye health routine, which you can immediately incorporate into your life, and includes a set of eye chart posters to use together with the book. This program is not only strengthening but also restorative and deeply relaxing. You will learn how to reverse developing issues before they cause damage and how to remedy existing problems including near- and far-sightedness and lazy eye as well as cataracts, glaucoma, optic neuritis, detached retinas and tears, macular degeneration, and retinitis pigmentosa. Vision for Life is not only for people who see poorly and would like to improve their vision, but also for those with 20/20 vision who wish to maintain their perfect eyesight as they grow older.

Clients of the Meir Schneider Self-Healing Method experience their own capacity to bring about recovery, reversing the progress of a wide range of degenerative conditions such as arthritis and muscular dystrophy as well as eye disease. Based in part on the established Bates Method of eyesight improvement and in part on his own professional and personal discoveries, Meir Schneider's pioneering approach has helped thousands of people successfully treat a host of eye problems, including nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism, lazy eye, double vision, glaucoma, cataracts, macular degeneration, retinal detachment, retinitis pigmentosa, and nystagmus.

Born blind to deaf parents, Schneider underwent a series of painful operations as a young child and was left with ninety-nine percent scar tissue on his eyes, resulting in his being declared incurably blind. At the age of seventeen, he discovered how to improve his vision from one percent to fifty-five percent of normal vision with the eye exercises presented in this book. Today Schneider drives a car, reads, and proves time and again that vision can and does improve with exercise. His contributions to the field of self-healing are recognized by alternative health practitioners and medical doctors alike.","[""Health"",""Nonfiction"",""Self Help""]",1/1/2012,2012.0,"{""name"":""Meir Schneider"",""num_books"":25,""num_followers"":""13""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":6,""reviews_percentage"":3},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":7,""reviews_percentage"":3},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":36,""reviews_percentage"":18},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":55,""reviews_percentage"":28},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":92,""reviews_percentage"":46}}","""$12.99""",internal,external_focus,False

Clark""]",4.01,74,11.0,"Picasso and Truth offers a breathtaking and original new look at the most significant artist of the modern era. From Pablo Picasso's early ""The Blue Room"" to the later ""Guernica,"" eminent art historian T. J. Clark offers a striking reassessment of the artist's paintings from the 1920s and 1930s. Why was the space of a room so basic to Picasso's worldview? And what happened to his art when he began to feel that room-space become too confined--too little exposed to the catastrophes of the twentieth century? Clark explores the role of space and the interior, and the battle between intimacy and monstrosity, in Picasso's art. Based on the A. W. Mellon Lectures in the Fine Arts delivered at the National Gallery of Art, this lavishly illustrated volume remedies the biographical and idolatrous tendencies of most studies on Picasso, reasserting the structure and substance of the artist's work.

With compelling insight, Clark focuses on three central works--the large-scale ""Guitar and Mandolin on a Table"" (1924), ""The Three Dancers"" (1925), and ""The Painter and His Model"" (1927)--and explores Picasso's answer to Nietzsche's belief that the age-old commitment to truth was imploding in modern European culture. Masterful in its historical contextualization, ""Picasso and Truth"" rescues Picasso from the celebrity culture that trivializes his accomplishments and returns us to the tragic vision of his art--humane and appalling, naive and difficult, in mourning for a lost nineteenth century, yet utterly exposed to the hell of Europe between the wars.","[""Art"",""Art History"",""Spain"",""Nonfiction"",""History"",""Philosophy"",""Biography"",""Essays""]",5/5/2013,2013.0,"{""name"":""T.J.

With sixteen pages of photographs, and vivid vignettes of scientists and their inventions, Crump guides readers through early attempts to measure time and space—from astronomical charts and calendars to Arabic numerals and algebraic notation—before he examines the birth of an essentially modern technology in the 1600s. With Galileo's telescopic exploration of the skies at the beginning of the seventeenth century and Newton's experiments with the prism and light at its end, the optical instruments fundamental to all scientific research had been invented. Crump then proceeds to electromagnets, cathode tubes, thermometers, vacuum pumps, X rays, accelerators, semiconductors, microprocessors, and instruments currently being designed to operate in subzero temperatures. Here, then, in an accessible, succinctly narrated volume, is the enduring human quest for knowledge through technology. Here, too, is the proof that what is knowable is, and has always been, far more compelling than what is known.

In this new biography of Mikhail Bakunin, Mark Leier traces the life and ideas of anarchism's first major thinker, and in the process revealing the origins of the movement.
There was little in Bakunin's background to suggest that he would grow up to be anything other than a loyal subject of the Russian Empire. Instead, he became one the most notorious radicals of the nineteenth century, devoting his life to the destruction of the tsar and feudalism, capitalism, the state, even God. In the process, he became a historical actor and political thinker whose ideas continue to influence world events.
Bakunin is of keen interest these days, though the attention paid to his image continues to obscure the man and his ideas. Using archival sources and the most recent scholarship, Leier corrects many of the popular misconceptions about Bakunin and his ideas, offering a fresh interpretation of Bakunin's life and thoughts of use to those interested in understanding anarchism and social change. Arguing for the relevance and importance of anarchism to our present world, Leier sheds light on the nineteenth century, as well as on today's headlines, as he examines a political philosophy that has inspired mass movements and contemporary social critics.
Mark Leier shows that the ""passion for destruction"" is a call to build a new world free of oppression, not a cult of violence. He argues that anarchism is a philosophy of morality and solidarity, based not on wishful thinking or naïve beliefs about the goodness of humanity but on a practical, radical critique of wealth and power. By studying Bakunin, we can learn a great deal about our own time and begin to recover a world of possibility and promise. It is often said that we are all anarchists at heart. This book explains why.","[""Biography"",""History"",""Politics"",""Nonfiction"",""Philosophy"",""Russia"",""Activism""]",1/1/2006,2006.0,"{""name"":""Mark Leier"",""num_books"":14,""num_followers"":""13""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":2,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":9,""reviews_percentage"":5},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":34,""reviews_percentage"":19},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":69,""reviews_percentage"":38},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":64,""reviews_percentage"":35}}","""$13.49""",external,external_focus,True

Unfortunately, many proposals for improving our communities rely on renewed governmental efforts without a similar recognition that the inflexibility and poor accountability of governments have often worsened society's ills. The Voluntary City investigates the history of large-scale, private provision of social services, the for-profit provision of urban infrastructure and community governance, and the growing privatization of residential life in the United States to argue that most decentralized, competitive markets can contribute greatly to community renewal.


Among the fascinating topics covered  how mutual-aid societies in America, Great Britain, and Australia provided their members with medical care, unemployment insurance, sickness insurance, and other social services before the welfare state; how private law, known historically as the law merchant, is returning in the form of arbitration; and why the rise of neighborhood associations represents the most comprehensive privatization occurring in the United States today.


The volume concludes with an epilogue that places the discoveries of The Voluntary City within the theory of market and government failure and discusses the implications of these discoveries for theories about the private provision of public goods. A refreshing challenge to the position that insists government alone can improve community life, The Voluntary City will be of special interest to students of history, law, urban life, economics, and government.

Mean Mothers reveals the multigenerational thread that often runs through these stories—many unloving mothers are the daughters of unloving or hypercritical women—and explores what happens to a daughter's sense of self and to her relationships when her mother is emotionally absent or even cruel. But Mean Mothers is also a narrative of hope, recounting how daughters can get past the legacy of hurt to become whole within and to become loving mothers to the next generation of daughters. The personal stories of unloved daughters and sons and those of the author herself, are both unflinching and moving, and bring this most difficult of subjects to life.

Mean Mothers isn't just a book for daughters who've had difficult or impossible relationships with their mothers. By exposing the myths of motherhood that prevent us from talking about the women for whom mothering a daughter is fraught with ambivalence, tension, or even jealousy, Mean Mothers also casts a different light on the extraordinary influence mothers have over their female children as well as the psychological complexity and emotional depth of the mother-daughter relationship.","[""Nonfiction"",""Psychology"",""Self Help"",""Parenting"",""Relationships"",""Family"",""Abuse"",""Mental Health"",""Personal Development"",""Unfinished""]",1/1/2009,2009.0,"{""name"":""Peg Streep"",""num_books"":43,""num_followers"":""60""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":21,""reviews_percentage"":3},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":50,""reviews_percentage"":9},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":160,""reviews_percentage"":29},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":169,""reviews_percentage"":31},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":142,""reviews_percentage"":26}}","""$17.99""",internal,external_focus,False

From its diminutive origins in the 1920s as Hitler's personal bodyguard, by the late war years it grew to a sprawling organization of hundreds of thousands of men, with a field army (the Waffen-SS-Armed-SS) numbering nearly 40 divisions and huge corporate, racial, and political power in the Allgemeine-SS (General-SS).

Diane Ravitch—former assistant secretary of education and a leader in the drive to create a national curriculum—examines her career in education reform and repudiates positions that she once staunchly advocated. Drawing on over forty years of research and experience, Ravitch critiques today’s most popular ideas for restructuring schools, including privatization, standardized testing, punitive accountability, and the feckless multiplication of charter schools. She shows conclusively why the business model is not an appropriate way to improve schools. Using examples from major cities like New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Denver, and San Diego, Ravitch makes the case that public education today is in peril. Ravitch includes clear prescriptions for improving America’s schools:
*Leave decisions about schools to educators, not politicians or businessmen
*Devise a truly national curriculum that sets out what children in every grade should be learning
*Expect charter schools to educate the kids who need help the most, not to compete with public schools
*Pay teachers a fair wage for their work, not “merit pay” based on deeply flawed and unreliable test scores
*Encourage family involvement in education from an early ageThe Death and Life of the Great American School System is more than just an analysis of the state of play of the American education system.

Crafted with the same care and insight as her award-winning novels, Absence of Mind challenges postmodern atheists who crusade against religion under the banner of science. In Robinson’s view, scientific reasoning does not denote a sense of logical infallibility, as thinkers like Richard Dawkins might suggest. Instead, in its purest form, science represents a search for answers. It engages the problem of knowledge, an aspect of the mystery of consciousness, rather than providing a simple and final model of reality.

By defending the importance of individual reflection, Robinson celebrates the power and variety of human consciousness in the tradition of William James. She explores the nature of subjectivity and considers the culture in which Sigmund Freud was situated and its influence on his model of self and civilization. Through keen interpretations of language, emotion, science, and poetry, Absence of Mind restores human consciousness to its central place in the religion-science debate.","[""Philosophy"",""Nonfiction"",""Essays"",""Religion"",""Science"",""Theology"",""Psychology"",""Spirituality"",""Sociology"",""Criticism""]",1/1/2010,2010.0,"{""name"":""Marilynne Robinson"",""num_books"":48,""num_followers"":""5257""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":31,""reviews_percentage"":3},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":63,""reviews_percentage"":6},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":217,""reviews_percentage"":22},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":393,""reviews_percentage"":41},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":248,""reviews_percentage"":26}}","""$11.99""",external,external_focus,True

In One Buck at a Time , company cofounder Macon Brock leads readers through the twisty path that saw Dollar Tree mushroom from a humble five-and-dime in Norfolk, Virginia, into one of the fastest-growing businesses in America—one that today operates more than 14,000 stores, provides jobs for 165,000 people, and is climbing the Fortune 500.

During every step of its growth, Dollar Tree has had to re-prove its concept to people who can’t believe its success. Not long after entering the marketplace, the company faced a crisis of conscience. In view of inflation and pressure from suppliers, how long could it stick to its one-dollar price point? Would it have to abandon its founding principle and become just another Walmart competitor?

Brock devised an experiment—he acquired a mixed bag of items Dollar Tree could sell for one dollar, for two dollars, for three and five, dumped them on a desk, and asked company officials to separate them into price piles.

They couldn’t do it. Even Brock was surprised.

One Buck at a Time is an informal history of budget retail and a how-to on doing it right. Brock credits everyone from executives to store managers and associates for their devotion to a corporate culture of value and service. And yes, he paints an entertaining picture of how Dollar Tree fulfills its mission—how it scours the globe to maintain the all-important price point while fashioning a product mix that never fails to surprise and delight.","[""Business"",""Biography"",""Nonfiction"",""Money"",""History"",""Finance""]",2/7/2017,2017.0,"{""name"":""Macon Brock"",""num_books"":1,""num_followers"":""2""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":0,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":3,""reviews_percentage"":3},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":25,""reviews_percentage"":28},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":31,""reviews_percentage"":35},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":29,""reviews_percentage"":32}}","""$9.99""",external,external_focus,True

Climate change, health care policy, weapons of mass destruction, an aging infrastructure, stem cell research, endangered species, space exploration—all affect our lives as citizens and human beings in practical and profound ways. But unless we understand the science behind these issues, we cannot make reasonable decisions—and worse, we are susceptible to propaganda cloaked in scientific rhetoric. To convey the facts, this book suggests, scientists must take a more active role in making their work accessible to the media, and thus to the public. In Am I Making Myself Clear? Cornelia Dean, a distinguished science editor and reporter, urges scientists to overcome their institutional reticence and let their voices be heard beyond the forum of scholarly publication. By offering useful hints for improving their interactions with policymakers, the public, and her fellow journalists, Dean aims to change the attitude of scientists who scorn the mass media as an arena where important work is too often misrepresented or hyped. Even more important, she seeks to convince them of the value and urgency of communicating to the public. Am I Making Myself Clear? shows scientists how to speak to the public, handle the media, and describe their work to a lay audience on paper, online, and over the airwaves. It is a book that will improve the tone and content of debate over critical issues and will serve the interests of science and society.","[""Science"",""Nonfiction"",""Writing"",""Business"",""Communication""]",1/1/2009,2009.0,"{""name"":""Cornelia Dean"",""num_books"":8,""num_followers"":""4""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":0,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":12,""reviews_percentage"":13},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":37,""reviews_percentage"":42},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":24,""reviews_percentage"":27},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":15,""reviews_percentage"":17}}","""$15.20""",external,external_focus,True

A falling apple inspired Isaac Newton’s insight into the law of gravity—or so the story goes. Is it true? Perhaps not. But the more intriguing question is why such stories endure as explanations of how science happens. Newton’s Apple and Other Myths about Science brushes away popular misconceptions to provide a clearer picture of great scientific breakthroughs from ancient times to the present.

Among the myths refuted in this volume is the idea that no science was done in the Dark Ages, that alchemy and astrology were purely superstitious pursuits, that fear of public reaction alone led Darwin to delay publishing his theory of evolution, and that Gregor Mendel was far ahead of his time as a pioneer of genetics. Several twentieth-century myths about particle physics, Einstein’s theory of relativity, and more are discredited here as well. In addition, a number of broad generalizations about science go under the microscope of history: the notion that religion impeded science, that scientists typically adhere to a codified “scientific method,” and that a bright line can be drawn between legitimate science and pseudoscience.

Edited by Ronald Numbers and Kostas Kampourakis, Newton’s Apple and Other Myths about Science debunks the widespread belief that science advances when individual geniuses experience “Eureka!” moments and suddenly comprehend what those around them could never imagine. Science has always been a cooperative enterprise of dedicated, fallible human beings, for whom context, collaboration, and sheer good luck are the essential elements of discovery.","[""Science"",""Nonfiction"",""History"",""History Of Science"",""Popular Science""]",10/5/2015,2015.0,"{""name"":""Kostas Kampourakis"",""num_books"":19,""num_followers"":""22""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":2,""reviews_percentage"":2},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":23,""reviews_percentage"":24},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":40,""reviews_percentage"":43},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":19,""reviews_percentage"":20},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":9,""reviews_percentage"":9}}","""$20.76""",external,external_focus,True

Ellis""]",3.95,45852,2179.0,"Informs our understanding of American politics--then and now--and gives us a new perspective on the unpredictable forces that shape history.

An illuminating study of the intertwined lives of the founders of the American republic--John Adams, Aaron Burr, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and George Washington.

During the 1790s, which Ellis calls the most decisive decade in our nation's history, the greatest statesmen of their generation--and perhaps any--came together to define the new republic and direct its course for the coming centuries. Ellis focuses on six discrete moments that exemplify the most crucial issues facing the fragile new nation: Burr and Hamilton's deadly duel, and what may have really happened; Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison's secret dinner, during which the seat of the permanent capital was determined in exchange for passage of Hamilton's financial plan; Franklin's petition to end the ""peculiar institution"" of slavery--his last public act--and Madison's efforts to quash it; Washington's precedent-setting Farewell Address, announcing his retirement from public office and offering his country some final advice; Adams's difficult term as Washington's successor and his alleged scheme to pass the presidency on to his son; and finally, Adams and Jefferson's renewed correspondence at the end of their lives, in which they compared their different views of the Revolution and its legacy.

In a lively and engaging narrative, Ellis recounts the sometimes collaborative, sometimes archly antagonistic interactions between these men, and shows us the private characters behind the public personas: Adams, the ever-combative iconoclast, whose closest political collaborator was his wife, Abigail; Burr, crafty, smooth, and one of the most despised public figures of his time; Hamilton, whose audacious manner and deep economic savvy masked his humble origins; Jefferson, renowned for his eloquence, but so reclusive and taciturn that he rarely spoke more than a few sentences in public; Madison, small, sickly, and paralyzingly shy, yet one of the most effective debaters of his generation; and the stiffly formal Washington, the ultimate realist, larger-than-life, and America's only truly indispensable figure.

Ellis argues that the checks and balances that permitted the infant American republic to endure were not primarily legal, constitutional, or institutional, but intensely personal, rooted in the dynamic interaction of leaders with quite different visions and values. Revisiting the old-fashioned idea that character matters, Founding Brothers informs our understanding of American politics--then and now--and gives us a new perspective on the unpredictable forces that shape history.","[""History"",""Nonfiction"",""American History"",""Biography"",""American Revolution"",""Politics"",""Historical"",""School"",""Presidents"",""American Revolutionary War""]",10/17/2000,2000.0,"{""name"":""Joseph J.

Their passengers, Pierre Méchain and Jean-Baptiste Delambre, were astronomers charged by the French Revolutionary government with the task of measuring the meridian that passes through these two cities in order to devise one universal unit of measure, ""for all time and for all men,"" the meter.

The Measure of the World by Denis Guedj tells the story of this strange and wonderful effort. Not a traditional history of science, the book is a novelistic account of the measurement project that relies heavily on archival sources. A more ""traditional"" history could not possibly describe how a sober scientific enterprise could turn into a journey filled with adventures and experiences so bizarre as to be hardly credible. In the tumultuous days of revolutionary and postrevolutionary France, Méchain and Delambre were objects of suspicion as they traveled through the provinces, climbing steeples and deploying strange instrumentsthey were detained as spies, taken for charlatans or fleeing royalists, and arrested for debt. Their perilous labors lasted until 1799, when the meter was formally established.

Arthur Goldhammer's crisp translation of this wonderful novel retains the flavor of the original, and an appendix explaining Guedj's use of historical materials is included. A vivid re-creation of a fascinating and troubling period in history juxtaposed with the achievement of a complicated scientific undertaking, The Measure of the World is a marvelous book-not science fiction, but fiction about science.

Denis Guedj is the author of La évolution des savants and L'Empire des nombres , among other books. La Mesure du monde was awarded the Prix d'Institut in 1989. Arthur Goldhammer is an award-winning translator who has translated works by Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, Jacques Le Goff, and Jean Starobinski.","[""History"",""Mathematics"",""Nonfiction"",""Science""]",5/6/1997,1997.0,"{""name"":""Denis Guedj"",""num_books"":24,""num_followers"":""57""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":2,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":9,""reviews_percentage"":8},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":42,""reviews_percentage"":37},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":42,""reviews_percentage"":37},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":16,""reviews_percentage"":14}}",,external,external_focus,True

A truly eccentric contribution.""--The New York Times Book Review  

Earthquakes. Wildfires. Floods. Drought. Tornadoes. Snakes in the sea, mountain lions, and a plague of bees. In this controversial tour de force of scholarship, unsparing vision, and inspired writing, Mike Davis, the author of City of Quartz, revisits Los Angeles as a Book of the Apocalypse theme park. By brilliantly juxtaposing L.A.'s fragile natural ecology with its disastrous environmental and social history, he compellingly shows a city deliberately put in harm's way by land developers, builders, and politicians, even as the incalculable toll of inevitable future catas-trophe continues to accumulate.

Counterpointing L.A.'s central role in America's fantasy life--the city has been destroyed no less than 138 times in novels and films since 1909--with its wanton denial of its own real history, Davis creates a revelatory kaleidoscope of American fact, imagery, and sensibility.  Drawing upon a vast array of sources, Ecology of Fear meticulously captures the nation's violent malaise and desperate social unease at the millennial end of ""the American century.""  With savagely entertaining wit and compassionate rage, this book conducts a devastating reconnaissance of our all-too-likely urban future.

BOOK EXCERPT:  By the time Hugh Glass reached Fort Tilton it was well into November. A foot of snow lay across the countryside. Fort Tilton was a small fort that belonged to the Columbia Fur Company. It had been built by William P. Tilton and boasted a garrison of only five men. As it sat near the site of another Mandan village, the Mandans who escorted Hugh dropped him off, then immediately went to visit their cousins. Hugh went to see Tilton, where he learned right away that any hopes of finding a boat to continue his journey were in vain.  “Mr. Glass,” Tilton told Hugh, “I’d like to help you but I can’t. I’ve got five men here, besides myself. I can’t spare any of them. We’re under danger of attack here night and day by the Arikaras. I need every man I have to keep them away. Even if I could spare anyone, I doubt they would go. We’re watched constantly. I had one man who left the fort for only a few minutes. From out of nowhere, that devil Stanapat rode up and killed him, practically on our doorstep. If you hadn’t had the Mandans escorting you, don’t think for a moment that you would have made it in here. Those damn Arikaras would have gotten you before you even came within sight of the fort.”  Disappointed, Hugh exhaled heavily.  “Stanapat,” he said ruefully. “—The Little Hawk With The Bloody Hand…”  Tilton looked at him.  “You speak Arikara?” he asked Hugh.  “Pawnee,” Hugh said absently. “The two languages are almost identical.”  Tilton continued to stare at him. Slowly, a look of dread came over his features.  “Oh no,” Tilton said. “Oh, Christ, I should have known by your scars—you’re the one the Indians call White Bear.”  Hugh gave him a puzzled look.  “How did you know?”  “Mister, you’re the talk of the plains. BIG medicine. Went one on one with a grizzly, left for dead by two white men and still managed to crawl to Fort Kiowa. The Arikaras have tried to kill you and can’t, that’s what they say. Oh, I know all about you. So does every tribe from here to the Rockies. As soon as Stanapat finds out you’re here—and he will—he’ll tear this place down to get to you.

Everybody knows mobile is the future, and every business wants in, but what are the elements of mobile success? SC Moatti, a Silicon Valley veteran, has created a unique Mobile Formula that makes it easy for any business to develop a strategy for creating mobile products that count. Moatti argues that we so identify with our mobile products that we expect from them what we wish for ourselves: an attractive body, a meaningful life, and increasing competence and ability. So the Body Rule dictates that mobile products must appeal to our sense of beauty but beauty in a mobile world is both similar to and different from what it means offline. The Spirit Rule says mobile products must help us address our deepest needs, both as individuals and as members of communities. And the Mind Rule explains that businesses that want to succeed in mobile need to continually analyze the user experience and use that data to refine and improve their products.  Great mobile products replicate and amplify human behavior and interaction, writes Moatti. They don't replace human relationships; they enhance them. A strategy manual rather than a technical treatise, Mobilized includes case studies from mobile pioneers such as Facebook, Uber, Tinder, WhatsApp, and more. The market is full of how-to books for programming apps, but no works examine what is required for business success in the mobile era.

Returning Marx to the Victorian confines of the nineteenth century, Jonathan Sperber, one of the United States’ leading European historians, challenges many of our misconceptions of this political firebrand turned London émigré journalist. In this deeply humanizing portrait, Marx no longer is the Olympian soothsayer, divining the dialectical imperatives of human history, but a scholar-activist whose revolutionary Weltanschauung was closer to Robespierre’s than to those of twentieth-century Marxists.

With unlimited access to the MEGA (the Marx-Engels Gesamtausgabe, the total edition of Marx’s and Engels’s writings), only recently available, Sperber juxtaposes the private man, the public agitator, and the philosopher-economist. We first see Marx as a young boy in the city of Trier, influenced by his father, Heinrich, for whom “the French Revolution and its aftermath offered an opportunity to escape the narrowly circumscribed social and political position of Jews in the society.” For Heinrich’s generation, this worldview meant no longer being a member of the so-called Jewish nation, but for his son, the reverberations were infinitely greater—namely a life inspired by the doctrines of the Enlightenment and an implacable belief in human equality.

Contextualizing Marx’s personal story—his rambunctious university years, his loving marriage to the devoted Jenny von Westphalen (despite an illegitimate child with the family maid), his children’s tragic deaths, the catastrophic financial problems—within a larger historical stage, Sperber examines Marx’s public actions and theoretical publications against the backdrop of a European continent roiling with political and social unrest. Guided by newly translated notes, drafts, and correspondence, he highlights Marx’s often overlooked work as a journalist; his political activities in Berlin, Paris, and London; and his crucial role in both creating and destroying the International Working Men’s Association. With Napoleon III, Bismarck, Adam Smith, and Charles Darwin, among others, as supporting players, Karl Marx becomes not just a biography of a man but a vibrant portrait of an infinitely complex time.

Already hailed by Publishers Weekly as “a major work . . . likely to be the standard biography of Marx for many years,” Karl Marx promises to become the defining portrait of a towering historical figure.","[""Biography"",""History"",""Nonfiction"",""Politics"",""Philosophy"",""Economics"",""Biography Memoir"",""Germany"",""European History"",""Sociology""]",3/13/2013,2013.0,"{""name"":""Jonathan Sperber"",""num_books"":15,""num_followers"":""21""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":14,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":39,""reviews_percentage"":5},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":184,""reviews_percentage"":23},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":323,""reviews_percentage"":41},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":217,""reviews_percentage"":27}}","""$9.99""",external,internal_focus,True

On March 27, 1964, at 5:36 p.m., the biggest earthquake ever recorded in North America—and the second biggest ever in the world, measuring 9.2 on the Richter scale—struck Alaska, devastating coastal towns and villages and killing more than 130 people in what was then a relatively sparsely populated region. In a riveting tale about the almost unimaginable brute force of nature, New York Times science journalist Henry Fountain, in his first trade book, re-creates the lives of the villagers and townspeople living in Chenega, Anchorage, and Valdez; describes the sheer beauty of the geology of the region, with its towering peaks and 20-mile-long glaciers; and reveals the impact of the quake on the towns, the buildings, and the lives of the inhabitants. George Plafker, a geologist for the U.S. Geological Survey with years of experience scouring the Alaskan wilderness, is asked to investigate the Prince William Sound region in the aftermath of the quake, to better understand its origins.

It was also a land withered by drought and hunger, and a place where hope and opportunity were hard to find. But William had read about windmills in a book called Using Energy, and he dreamed of building one that would bring electricity and water to his village and change his life and the lives of those around him. His neighbors may have mocked him and called him misala—crazy—but William was determined to show them what a little grit and ingenuity could do.

Enchanted by the workings of electricity as a boy, William had a goal to study science in Malawi's top boarding schools. But in 2002, his country was stricken with a famine that left his family's farm devastated and his parents destitute. Unable to pay the eighty-dollar-a-year tuition for his education, William was forced to drop out and help his family forage for food as thousands across the country starved and died.

Yet William refused to let go of his dreams. With nothing more than a fistful of cornmeal in his stomach, a small pile of once-forgotten science textbooks, and an armory of curiosity and determination, he embarked on a daring plan to bring his family a set of luxuries that only two percent of Malawians could afford and what the West considers a necessity—electricity and running water. Using scrap metal, tractor parts, and bicycle halves, William forged a crude yet operable windmill, an unlikely contraption and small miracle that eventually powered four lights, complete with homemade switches and a circuit breaker made from nails and wire. A second machine turned a water pump that could battle the drought and famine that loomed with every season.

Soon, news of William's magetsi a mphepo—his ""electric wind""—spread beyond the borders of his home, and the boy who was once called crazy became an inspiration to those around the world.

But then, he didn’t need me.”---Ron Powers, New York Times bestselling coauthor of Flags of Our Fathers and author of Mark  A Life “A beautifully crafted anthem to doomed American youth, James Carl Nelson’s The Remains of Company D is a must-read for World War I enthusiasts and those looking for a damn good war book.”---Alex Kershaw, New York Times bestselling author of The Longest Winter and The Bedford Boys “War is always hell, but the unprecedented carnage on World War I’s Western Front was the stuff of nightmares. The American boys of Company D were on the front lines, and James Carl Nelson has combined previously unpublished first-person accounts, prodigious research, and vivid, you-are-there prose into one of the great books on the subject. This is a Band of Brothers for World War I.”---James Donovan, author of A Terrible  Custer and the Little Bighorn—the Last Great Battle of the American West “James Carl Nelson’s book is a great contribution to AEF history. He has done an incredible amount of research in order to convey the experience of one group of doughboys...and to tell their story through their own words.….He reminds us that these long-forgotten battles of ninety years ago were as hard fought as any before or since, and that our country was well served by the young men who fought them. Get this book. It puts a very human face on the experience of Americans on the Western Front.”---Dr. Paul Herbert, executive director of the Cantigny First Division Foundation
Haunted by an ancestor’s tale of near death on a distant battlefield, James Carl Nelson set out in pursuit of the scraps of memory of his grandfather’s small infantry unit. Years of travel across the world led to the retrieval of unpublished personal papers, obscure memoirs, and communications from numerous Doughboys as well as original interviews of the descendents of his grandfather’s comrades in arms. The result is a compelling tale of battle rooted in new primary sources, and one man’s search for his grandfather’s legacy in a horrifying maelstrom that is today poorly understood and nearly forgotten. The Remains of Company D follows the members of Company D, 28th Infantry Regiment, United States First Division, from enlistment to combat to the effort to recover their remains, focusing on the three major battles at Cantigny, Soissons, and in the Meuse-Argonne and the effect these horrific battles had on the men. This is an important and powerful tale of the different destinies, personalities, and motivations of the men in Company D and a timeless portrayal of men at war.","[""History"",""Nonfiction"",""World War I"",""War"",""Military Fiction"",""Military History"",""American"",""American History"",""20th Century"",""Historical""]",1/1/2009,2009.0,"{""name"":""James Carl Nelson"",""num_books"":10,""num_followers"":""31""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":4,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":14,""reviews_percentage"":5},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":76,""reviews_percentage"":28},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":101,""reviews_percentage"":37},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":75,""reviews_percentage"":27}}","""$11.99""",external,external_focus,True

Even during his lifetime Whitefield was considered ""the most brilliant and popular preacher the modern world has ever known."" In the wake of his fearless preaching, revival swept across the British Isles, and the Great Awakening transformed the American colonies. When Whitefield died at age 55, he had preached 30,000 sermons. His hearers included not only the poor and the uneducated, but prominent English aristocrats and American statesmen such as David Hume and Benjamin Franklin. Christians today continue to take courage from Whitefield's humility and deep spirituality. A founder of Methodism, he yielded his leadership to John Wesley rather than risk splitting the movement, thus revealing his fervent commitment to the gospel of Christ rather than to personal plans or hopes. The previous two-volume work, receiving critical praise and popular acceptance, is here condensed into one magnificent volume. A great inspiration to the followers of Jesus Christ in today's pressured world. ""Perhaps the single most inspiring biography published in English in the 20th century. A masterful work."" --Sherwood Eliot Wirt, founding editor, Decision magazine ""I feel a permanent debt of gratitude to Dr. Dallimore.

A trumpet virtuoso, seductive crooner, and consummate entertainer, Armstrong laid the foundation for the future of jazz with his stylistic innovations, but his story would be incomplete without examining how he struggled in a society seething with brutally racist ideologies, laws, and practices.

Thomas Brothers picks up where he left off with the acclaimed Louis Armstrong's New Orleans, following the story of the great jazz musician into his most creatively fertile years in the 1920s and early 1930s, when Armstrong created not one but two modern musical styles. Brothers wields his own tremendous skill in making the connections between history and music accessible to everyone as Armstrong shucks and jives across the page. Through Brothers's expert ears and eyes we meet an Armstrong whose quickness and sureness, so evident in his performances, served him well in his encounters with racism while his music soared across the airwaves into homes all over America.

Louis Armstrong, Master of Modernism blends cultural history, musical scholarship, and personal accounts from Armstrong's contemporaries to reveal his enduring contributions to jazz and popular music at a time when he and his bandmates couldn’t count on food or even a friendly face on their travels across the country. Thomas Brothers combines an intimate knowledge of Armstrong's life with the boldness to examine his place in such a racially charged landscape. In vivid prose and with vibrant photographs, Brothers illuminates the life and work of the man many consider to be the greatest American musician of the twentieth century.","[""Biography"",""Music"",""Nonfiction"",""History"",""Jazz"",""Biography Memoir"",""Cultural"",""American History""]",2/3/2014,2014.0,"{""name"":""Thomas Brothers"",""num_books"":24,""num_followers"":""4""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":5,""reviews_percentage"":4},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":8,""reviews_percentage"":7},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":20,""reviews_percentage"":19},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":39,""reviews_percentage"":38},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":29,""reviews_percentage"":28}}","""$9.99""",external,external_focus,True

Even after her execution in May 1536, on trumped-up charges of adultery, her reputation has been pursued beyond the grave, subjected to all manner of accusation. The unsavory account of her life that has come down through history is one shaped by her enemies. Joanna Denny's powerful new biography presents a radically different picture of Anne-a woman who was highly literate, accomplished, and a devout defender of her Protestant faith. Her tragedy was that her looks and vivacious charm attracted the notice of a violent and paranoid king and trapped her in the vicious politics of the Tudor court, where a deadly game was being played between the old nobility and the new, between the old faith and the new.

And this is precisely what Bruce Fink does in this ambitious book, a fine analysis of Lacan's work on language and psychoanalytic treatment conducted on the basis of a very close reading of texts in his Icrits: A Selection. As a translator and renowned proponent of Lacan's works, Fink is an especially adept and congenial guide through the complexities of Lacanian literature and concepts. He devotes considerable space to notions that have been particularly prone to misunderstanding, notions such as ""the sliding of the signified under the signifier,""or that have gone seemingly unnoticed, such as ""the ego is the metonymy of desire."" Fink also pays special attention to psychoanalytic concepts, like affect, that Lacan is sometimes thought to neglect, and to controversial concepts, like the phallus. From a parsing of Lacan's claim that ""commenting on a text is like doing an analysis,"" to sustained readings of ""The Instance of the Letter in the Unconscious,"" ""The Direction of the Treatment,"" and ""Subversion of the Subject"" (with particular attention given to the workings of the Graph of Desire), Fink's book is a work of unmatched subtlety, depth, and detail, providing a valuable new perspective on one of the twentieth century's most important thinkers. Bruce Fink is a practicing Lacanian psychoanalyst, analytic supervisor, and professor of psychology at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh. He is the author of A Clinical Introduction to LacanianPsychoanalysis (1997) and The Lacanian Subject (1995). He has coedited three volumes on Lacan's seminars and is the translator of Lacan's Seminar XX, On Feminine Sexuality, the Limits of Love and Knowledge (1998), Icrits: A Selection (2002), and Icrits: The Complete Text (forthcoming).","[""Psychoanalysis"",""Psychology"",""Philosophy"",""Theory"",""Nonfiction"",""France"",""21st Century""]",4/1/2004,2004.0,"{""name"":""Bruce Fink"",""num_books"":46,""num_followers"":""135""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":2,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":3,""reviews_percentage"":2},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":20,""reviews_percentage"":15},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":52,""reviews_percentage"":40},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":50,""reviews_percentage"":39}}","""$11.99""",external,internal_focus,False

Eva Wong, a leading Taoist practitioner and translator, provides a solid introduction to the Way. All of Taoism’s most important texts, figures, and events are covered, as well as its extraordinarily rich history and remarkable variety of practice. Sections include:
 
• The History of Taoism traces the development of the tradition from the shamans of prehistoric China through the classical period (including the teachings of the famous sage Lao-tzu), the beginnings of Taoism as a religion, the rise of mystical and alchemical Taoism, and the synthesis of Taoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism.

• Systems of Taoism explores magical sects, divination practices, devotional ceremonies, internal alchemy, and the way of right action.

• Taoist Practices discusses meditation, techniques of cultivating the body, and rites of purification, ceremony, and talismanic magic.

This roadmap to the spiritual landscape of Taoism not only introduces the important events in the history of Taoism, the sages who wrote the Taoist texts, and the various schools of Taoist thinking, but also gives readers a feel for what it means to practice Taoism today.

The New York Times and USA Today found it ""definitive."" The Seattle Times said Gates ""should be required reading for any new hire in the personal computer industry."" Since its publication, Gates has been cited and used as a source by dozens of books and articles.

Bill Gates is an American icon, the ultimate revenge of the nerd. The youngest self-made billionaire in history was for many years the most powerful person in the computer industry. His tantrums, his odd rocking tic, and his lavish philanthropy have become the stuff of legend. Gates is the one book that truly illuminates the early years of the man and his company.

In high school he organized computer enterprises for profit. At Harvard he co-wrote Microsoft BASIC, the first commercial personal computer software, then dropped out and made it a global standard. At 25, he offered IBM a program he did not yet own--a program called DOS that would become the essential operating system for more than 100 million personal computers and the foundation of the Gates empire. As Microsoft's dominance extended around the globe, Bill Gates became idolized, hated, and feared.

In this riveting independent biography, veteran computer journalists Stephen Manes and Paul Andrews draw on a dozen sessions with Gates himself and nearly a thousand hours of interviews with his friends, family, employees, and competitors to debunk the myths and paint the definitive picture of the real Bill Gates, ""bugs"" and all.

Here is the shy but fearless competitor with the guts and brass to try anything once--on a computer, at a negotiation, or on water skis. Here is the cocky 23-year-old who calmly spurned an enormous buyout offer from Ross Perot. Here is the supersalesman who motivated his Smart Guys, fought bitter battles with giant IBM, and locked horns with Apple's Steve Jobs--and usually won.

Here, too, is the workaholic pessimist who presided over Microsoft's meteoric rise while most other personal computer pioneers fell by the wayside. Gates extended his vision of software to art, entertainment, education, and even biotechnology, and made good on much of his promise to put his software ""on every desk and in every home.""

Gates is a bracing, comprehensive portrait of the microcomputer industry, one of its leading companies, and the man who helped create a world where software is everything.","[""Biography"",""Business"",""Technology"",""Nonfiction"",""History"",""Computer Science"",""Entrepreneurship"",""Leadership"",""Software"",""Finance""]",12/1/1992,1992.0,"{""name"":""Stephen Manes"",""num_books"":37,""num_followers"":""22""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":8,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":25,""reviews_percentage"":4},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":102,""reviews_percentage"":18},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":197,""reviews_percentage"":36},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":205,""reviews_percentage"":38}}","""$9.99""",external,external_focus,True

Wilbarger, a pioneer who had emigrated to Texas in 1837, was fully aware of the dangers that he faced by living on the frontier of the American West as his own brother had miraculously survived being scalped and left for dead in 1833. Over the course of the next fifty years Wilbarger compiled accounts of Native American attacks that formed the basis of his book. Yet, rather than simply relying on hearsay and rumors of attacks, he sought out the victims and as he states in his Preface, many of the articles had been “written by others, who were either cognizant of the facts themselves or had obtained them from reliable sources."" This book is fascinating work that remains an importance source covering the early settlement of the region by Americans, based on stories told by surviving pioneers. ""unique among pioneer chronicles."" — J. Frank Dobie J. B. Wilbarger was a Methodist minister, author and pioneer. He first moved West to Texas in 1837 at the urging of his brother Josiah Pugh Wilbarger. His book Indian Depredations in Texas was first published in 1889 and he passed away in 1892.","[""History"",""Native Americans"",""Nonfiction""]",1/1/1985,1985.0,"{""name"":""J.W.

Slowly man and bird entered a state of delirium and intoxication, of attraction and repulsion that looks very much like love. White kept a daybook describing his volatile relationship with Gos — at once a tale of obsession, a comedy of errors, and a hymn to the hawk.

If he had not invaded Sicily and Naples, we in the north would have the richest and most civilized state in Europe.' After looking cautiously round the room he added in an even lower voice, 'Of course to the south we would have a neighbour like Egypt.''

Was the elderly Italian right? The Pursuit of Italy traces the whole history of the Italian peninsula in a wonderfully readable style, full of well-chosen stories and observations from personal experience, and peopled by many of the great figures of the Italian past, from Cicero and Virgil to Dante and the Medici, from Cavour and Verdi to the controversial political figures of the twentieth century. The book gives a clear-eyed view of the Risorgimento, the pivotal event in modern Italian history, debunking the influential myths which have grown up around it.

Gilmour shows that the glory of Italy has always lain in its regions, with their distinctive art, civic cultures, identities and cuisine. The regions produced the medieval communes and the Renaissance, the Venetian Republic and the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, two of the most civilized states of European history. Their inhabitants identified themselves not as Italians, but as Tuscans and Venetians, Sicilians and Lombards, Neapolitans and Genoese. This is where the strength and culture of Italy still comes from, rather than from misconceived and mishandled concepts of nationalism and unity.

He reclines in a deck chair in his modern apartment in western India, telling subtle and entertaining folk narratives to his assorted gatherings. Among the listeners is Kirin Narayan, who knew Swamiji when she was a child in India and who has returned from America as an anthropologist. In her book Narayan builds on Swamiji's tales and his audiences' interpretations to ask why religious teachings the world over are so often couched in stories.



For centuries, religious teachers from many traditions have used stories to instruct their followers. When Swamiji tells a story, the local barber rocks in helpless laughter, and a sari-wearing French nurse looks on enrapt. Farmers make decisions based on the tales, and American psychotherapists take notes that link the storytelling to their own practices. Narayan herself is a key character in this ethnography. As both a local woman and a foreign academic, she is somewhere between participant and observer, reacting to the nuances of fieldwork with a sensitivity that only such a position can bring.

Each story s reproduced in its evocative performance setting. Narayan supplements eight folk narratives with discussions of audience participation and response as well as relevant Hindu themes. All these stories focus on the complex figure of the Hindu ascetic and so sharpen our understanding of renunciation and gurus in South Asia.

What is the Midnight Dog Walkers' Club? If you have a reactive or aggressive dog, and you find yourself walking him in the middle of the night or at the break of dawn to avoid meeting other people and dogs, you are already a member of this exclusive club to which nobody wants to belong. Aggression is a subject that no dog owner wants to talk about, but one that many must face. Statistics show that aggression is not only the most serious problem in dogs but also the top reason for owners to seek out professional help for their pets. Left unchecked, an aggressive dog can become a dangerous dog, and this informative volume comes to the aid of many heartbroken owners who feel that they have tried everything to correct their dogs' unpredictable and inappropriate behavior. Author and certified dog trainer Annie Phenix shares her belief that many reactive dogs can be rehabilitated with the right training, and she offers her expertise in positive, force-free training methods to desperate owners who have resorted to extreme measures to keep their dogs away from other people and animals. Inside this book, Phenix addresses the often-taboo topics of reactivity and aggression in canines, speaking to owners honestly and candidly from the vantage point of her own experiences, successes, and even heartbreaks. Using reward-centered, scientifically based techniques with a focus on the all-important human–canine bond, Phenix introduces owners to training methods to help their dogs recover from fear, anxiety, and aggression in collaboration with a professional trainer or behaviorist. Inside The Midnight Dog Walkers , you'll find stories and practical examples from the author based on aggressive dogs she's trained and owned; behavioral warning signs that owners should recognize; definitions of different types of aggression and why they occur; tips on how to handle a potentially aggressive or aggressive dog; the author's force-free training philosophy and how she applies it with her clients to effect positive changes; popular myths and misconceptions about training these ""grumpy growlers""; how to open communication and cooperation between owners, trainers, and veterinarians; and more.

For more than three centuries, adults have agonized over raising children while children have followed their own paths to development and expression. Now, Steven Mintz gives us the first comprehensive history of American childhood encompassing both the child’s and the adult’s tumultuous early years of life.

Underscoring diversity through time and across regions, Mintz traces the transformation of children from the sinful creatures perceived by Puritans to the productive workers of nineteenth-century farms and factories, from the cosseted cherubs of the Victorian era to the confident consumers of our own. He explores their role in revolutionary upheaval, westward expansion, industrial growth, wartime mobilization, and the modern welfare state. Revealing the harsh realities of children’s lives through history―the rigors of physical labor, the fear of chronic ailments, the heartbreak of premature death―he also acknowledges the freedom children once possessed to discover their world as well as themselves.

Whether at work or play, at home or school, the transition from childhood to adulthood has required generations of Americans to tackle tremendously difficult challenges. Today, adults impose ever-increasing demands on the young for self-discipline, cognitive development, and academic achievement, even as the influence of the mass media and consumer culture has grown. With a nod to the past, Mintz revisits an alternative to the goal-driven realities of contemporary childhood. An odyssey of psychological self-discovery and growth, this book suggests a vision of childhood that embraces risk and freedom―like the daring adventure on Huck’s raft.","[""History"",""Nonfiction"",""Parenting"",""Education"",""Sociology"",""Childrens"",""United States"",""American History"",""Academic"",""Psychology""]",11/15/2004,2004.0,"{""name"":""Steven Mintz"",""num_books"":45,""num_followers"":""7""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":8,""reviews_percentage"":2},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":13,""reviews_percentage"":3},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":91,""reviews_percentage"":23},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":183,""reviews_percentage"":46},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":100,""reviews_percentage"":25}}","""$15.93""",external,external_focus,True

We call that rightness beauty, and it ought to be the single most important component of design.This recognition is at the heart of David Gelernter's witty argued essay, Machine Beauty, which defines beauty as an inspired mating of simplicity and power. You can see it in a Bauhaus chair, the Hoover Dam, or an Emerson radio circa 1930. In contrast, too many contemporary technologists run out of ideas and resort to gimmicks and features; they are rarely capable of real, structural ingenuity.Nowhere is this more evident than in the world of computers. You don't have to look far to see how oblivious most computer technologists are to the idea of beauty. Just look at how ugly your computer cabinet is, how unwieldy and out of sync it feels with the manner and speed with which you process thought.The best designers, however, are obsessed with beauty. Both hardware and software should afford us the greatest opportunity to achieve deep beauty, the kind of beauty that happens when many types of loveliness reinforce one another, when design expresses an underlying technology, a machine logic. Program software ought to be transparent; it should engage what Gelernter calls ”a thought-amplifying feedback loop,” a creative symbiosis with its user. These principles, beautiful in themselves, will set the stage for the next technological revolution, in which the pursuit of elegance will lead to extraordinary innovations. Machine Beauty will delight Gelernter's growing audience, fans of his provocative and biting journalism. Anyone who manufactures, designs, or uses computers will be galvanized by his cogent arguments and tantalizing glimpse of a bright future, where beautiful technology abounds.","[""Design"",""Computer Science"",""Nonfiction"",""Computers"",""Usability"",""Technology""]",1/1/1998,1998.0,"{""name"":""David Gelernter"",""num_books"":31,""num_followers"":""62""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":0,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":5,""reviews_percentage"":7},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":27,""reviews_percentage"":38},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":23,""reviews_percentage"":32},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":16,""reviews_percentage"":22}}",,external,external_focus,True

In recent years we've seen some of the most storied corporations go bankrupt (General Motors, Chrysler, Eastman Kodak) or disappear entirely (Bethlehem Steel, Lehman Brothers, Borders).

Gerald Davis argues this is a root cause of the income inequality and social instability we face today. Corporations were once an integral part of building the middle class. He points out that in their heyday they offered millions of people lifetime employment, a stable career path, health insurance, and retirement pensions.

We spend a lot of time traversing thresholds - both in our homes, and in our lives.
 
Of course, this is not a book about how to build a house; it is book about how build a rich and rewarding life.  When I talk about the thresholds of life, I am referring to those times of transition; when we are moving from the way we were accustomed to living to a new way of thinking, feeling, and being.
 
Every one of us will experience many such moments. Some will be exciting - a new job, a marriage, the birth of a child. Others - the death of a parent, an empty nest, a divorce –  will be painful. Either way, crossing from a “room” that is comfortable and familiar into one that feels uncertain and unpredictable, can be terrifying. 

But what if, instead of viewing these thresholds as barriers or obstacles, you could see them as doorways to bigger and better opportunities? If you could embrace change as a wellspring of motivation rather than a source of fear? If the thought of the unknown future left you feeling empowered and excited, instead of paralyzed?

Here, Sherre Hirsch draws on decades of counseling individuals of all faiths and religions, the wisdom of ancient stories, research from psychology, and tales from real life, to help readers summon the faith, courage, and confidence to embrace the exhilarating new possibilities and experiences that lie across the threshold.   With her signature warmth and empathic style, Hirsch, like a trusted friend,  wise counselor, and spiritual advisor rolled into one, guides readers through the most challenging – and the most blessed – transitions of their one precious life.","[""Nonfiction"",""Self Help"",""Spirituality"",""Religion""]",8/18/2015,2015.0,"{""name"":""Sherre Hirsch"",""num_books"":5,""num_followers"":""6""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":3,""reviews_percentage"":3},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":2,""reviews_percentage"":2},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":34,""reviews_percentage"":35},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":34,""reviews_percentage"":35},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":22,""reviews_percentage"":23}}","""$14.99""",internal,internal_focus,False

Mother of three. Labor organizer. Margaret Sanger—best known as the pioneer of birth control—was revolutionary in more ways than one. In Sabrina Jones’s graphic novel Our Lady of Birth Control , the author illustrates the incredible life of Margaret Sanger (1879-1966), framing the biography with her personal experiences of coming of age at the height of the sexual revolution.

During her lifetime, Sanger transformed herself from working class nurse to an exuberant free-lover and savvy manipulator of the media, the law, and her wealthy supporters. Through direct action, propaganda, exile, and imprisonment, she ultimately succeeded in bringing legal access to birth control to women of all classes. Sanger’s revolutionary actions established organizations that eventually evolved into Planned Parenthood Federation of America.

Jones’s autobiographical sections of Our Lady of Birth Control show her journey into activist art in response to the anti-feminist backlash of the Reagan era. From street theater and protest graphics to alternative comics, her path similarly follows in Margaret’s footsteps, encountering versions of the same adversaries. Her striking imagery evokes the late 20th century, recalling the ashcan artists of The Masses, an acclaimed magazine of Sanger’s formative years.

Most of us know we own too much stuff. We feel the weight and burden of our clutter, and we tire of cleaning and managing and organizing.
 
While excess consumption leads to bigger houses, faster cars, fancier technology, and cluttered homes, it never brings happiness. Rather, it results in a desire for more. It redirects our greatest passions to things that can never fulfill. And it distracts us from the very life we wish we were living.
 
Live a better life with less.
 
In The More of Less , Joshua Becker helps you...
 
• Recognize the life-giving benefits of owning less
• Realize how all the stuff you own is keeping you from pursuing your dreams
• Craft a personal, practical approach to decluttering your home and life
• Experience the joys of generosity
• Learn why the best part of minimalism isn’t a clean house, it’s a full life
 
The beauty of minimalism isn’t in what it takes away. It’s in what it gives. 
 
Make Room in Your Life for What You Really Want
 
“Maybe you don’t need to own all this stuff.”  After a casual conversation with his neighbor on Memorial Day 2008, Joshua Becker realized he needed a change. He was spending far too much time organizing possessions, cleaning up messes, and looking for more to buy.
 
So Joshua and his wife decided to remove the nonessential possessions from their home and life. Eventually, they sold, donated, or discarded over 60 percent of what they owned. In exchange, they found a life of more freedom, more contentment, more generosity, and more opportunity to pursue the things that mattered most.
 
The More of Less  delivers an empowering plan for living more by owning less. With practical suggestions and encouragement to personalize your own minimalist style, Joshua Becker shows you why  minimizing  possessions is the best way to  maximize  life.

Also included is a new, original biographical sketch discussing the author and his work.

Memory: How to Develop, Train and Use It is a time-tested, comprehensive study of the concepts and principles of memory improvement, written by New Thought and self-improvement pioneer William Walker Atkinson. Presented in a straightforward manner in plain language, the text guides the reader through a study of the general concepts of memory improvement and the application of these doctrines. The systematic, straightforward style of Atkinson's work makes the often abstract concepts accessible to all readers, as he explores topics like the subconscious retention of information, various systems for memorization, and the key roles of attention and association in the memory process.

Atkinson's work teaches specific methodologies for training the eyes and ears for memory improvement, and offers specific approaches to improving your memory for names, faces, places, numbers, events, music, specific facts, stories, words and sentences, and more.

For over one hundred years western students have been aided in their study of self-improvement principles, New Thought philosophy and eastern teachings by the writing of William Walker Atkinson, also known by his pseudonym, ""Yogi Ramacharaka."" William Walker Atkinson (1862-1932) was an incredibly prolific American writer who published extensively in areas of yoga, the occult, eastern mysticism, personal development, and related subjects. A successful businessman and attorney, Atkinson suffered what may have been a nervous breakdown in the late 1880's and, in the course of his recovery, became immersed in the ""new thought"" movement, eastern mysticism, and yoga.

Atkinson was a popular self-improvement and personal development writer, a leading voice in the New Thought movement and a serious and devoted student of Hindu philosophy and yoga, and was a major force in introducing these concepts to the United States. His writings are still widely read and well-respected, and his ""Yoga Philosophy and Oriental Occultism"" is considered an excellent basic text for the western layman.","[""Self Help"",""Psychology"",""Nonfiction"",""Personal Development"",""Brain"",""Audiobook"",""Science"",""Philosophy"",""Neuroscience"",""Reference""]",1/1/1911,1911.0,"{""about"":""Pseudonyms: Theron Q. Dumont, Yogi Ramacharaka, Swami Bhakta Vishita &amp; Swami PanchadasiWilliam Walker Atkinson (December 5, 1862 – November 22, 1932) was an attorney, merchant, publisher, and author, as well as an occultist and an American pioneer of the New Thought movement. He is also known to have been the author of the pseudonymous works attributed to Theron Q. Dumont, Swami Panchadasi and Yogi Ramacharaka and others.Due in part to Atkinson's intense personal secrecy and extensive use of pseudonyms, he is now largely forgotten, despite having obtained mention in past editions of Who's Who in America, Religious Leaders of America, and several similar publications—and having written more than 100 books in the last 30 years of his life. His works have remained in print more or less continuously since 1900.William Walker Atkinson was born in Baltimore, Maryland on December 5, 1862, to William and Emma Atkinson. He began his working life as a grocer at 15 years old, probably helping his father. He married Margret Foster Black of Beverly, New Jersey, in October 1889, and they had two children. The first probably died young. The second later married and had two daughters.Atkinson pursued a business career from 1882 onwards and in 1894 he was admitted as an attorney to the Bar of Pennsylvania. While he gained much material success in his profession as a lawyer, the stress and over-strain eventually took its toll, and during this time he experienced a complete physical and mental breakdown, and financial disaster. He looked for healing and in the late 1880s he found it with New Thought, later attributing the restoration of his health, mental vigor and material prosperity to the application of the principles of New Thought.Some time after his healing, Atkinson began to write articles on the truths he felt he had discovered, which were then known as Mental Science. In 1889, an article by him entitled \""A Mental Science Catechism,\"" appeared in Charles Fillmore's new periodical, Modern Thought.By the early 1890s Chicago had become a major centre for New Thought, mainly through the work of Emma Curtis Hopkins, and Atkinson decided to move there. Once in the city, he became an active promoter of the movement as an editor and author. He was responsible for publishing the magazines Suggestion (1900–1901), New Thought (1901–1905) and Advanced Thought (1906–1916).In 1900 Atkinson worked as an associate editor of Suggestion, a New Thought Journal, and wrote his probable first book, Thought-Force in Business and Everyday Life, being a series of lessons in personal magnetism, psychic influence, thought-force, concentration, will-power, and practical mental science.He then met Sydney Flower, a well-known New Thought publisher and businessman, and teamed up with him. In December, 1901 he assumed editorship of Flower's popular New Thought magazine, a post which he held until 1905. During these years he built for himself an enduring place in the hearts of its readers. Article after article flowed from his pen.

Yet this study is among the first to examine the relationship between ethnicity and identity among the largest immigrant group to that city. By focusing on Mexican immigrants to Los Angeles from 1900 to 1945, George J. Sánchez explores the process by which temporary sojourners altered their orientation to that of permanent residents, thereby laying the foundation for a new Mexican-American culture. Analyzing not only formal programs aimed at these newcomers by the United States and Mexico, but also the world created by these immigrants through family networks, religious practice, musical entertainment, and work and consumption patterns, Sánchez uncovers the creative ways Mexicans adapted their culture to life in the United States. When a formal repatriation campaign pushed thousands to return to Mexico, those remaining in Los
Angeles launched new campaigns to gain civil rights as ethnic Americans through labor unions and New Deal politics. The immigrant generation, therefore, laid the groundwork for the emerging Mexican-American identity of their children.","[""History"",""Nonfiction"",""Race"",""American History"",""Cultural"",""20th Century"",""Historical"",""Politics"",""The United States Of America"",""Grad School""]",12/23/1993,1993.0,"{""name"":""George J.

DiLorenzo""]",4.12,1950,235.0,"A New Look at Abraham Lincoln, His Agenda, and an Unnecessary WarMost Americans consider Abraham Lincoln to be the greatest president in history. His legend as the Great Emancipator has grown to mythic proportions as hundreds of books, a national holiday, and a monument in Washington, D.C., extol his heroism and martyrdom. But what if most everything you knew about Lincoln were false? What if, instead of an American hero who sought to free the slaves, Lincoln were in fact a calculating politician who waged the bloodiest war in american history in order to build an empire that rivaled Great Britain's? In The Real Lincoln, author Thomas J. DiLorenzo uncovers a side of Lincoln not told in many history books and overshadowed by the immense Lincoln legend. Through extensive research and meticulous documentation, DiLorenzo portrays the sixteenth president as a man who devoted his political career to revolutionizing the American form of government from one that was very limited in scope and highly decentralized—as the Founding Fathers intended—to a highly centralized, activist state. Standing in his way, however, was the South, with its independent states, its resistance to the national government, and its reliance on unfettered free trade. To accomplish his goals, Lincoln subverted the Constitution, trampled states' rights, and launched a devastating Civil War, whose wounds haunt us still. According to this provacative book, 600,000 American soldiers did not die for the honorable cause of ending slavery but for the dubious agenda of sacrificing the independence of the states to the supremacy of the federal government, which has been tightening its vise grip on our republic to this very day.You will discover a side of Lincoln that you were probably never taught in school—a side that calls into question the very myths that surround him and helps explain the true origins of a bloody, and perhaps, unnecessary war.","[""History"",""Biography"",""Politics"",""Nonfiction"",""American History"",""Civil War"",""War"",""American Civil War"",""Biography Memoir"",""American""]",1/1/2002,2002.0,"{""name"":""Thomas J.

The great traditional buildings of the past, the villages and tents and temples in which man feels at home, have always been made by people who were very close to the center of this way. It is not possible to make great buildings, or great towns, beautiful places, places where you feel yourself, places where you feel alive, except by following this way. And, as you will see, this way will lead anyone who looks for it to buildings which are themselves as ancient in their form as the trees and hills, and as our faces are.”

In Bones , Jennifer offers a collection of recipes for cooking beef, veal, pork, lamb, poultry, fish, and game on their bones. Chicken, steak, and fish all taste better when cooked on the bone, but we've sacrificed flavor for speed and convenience, forgetting how bones can enhance the taste, texture, and presentation of good food -- think of rack of lamb, T-bone steak, chicken noodle soup, and baked ham. In her simple, bare-bones style, Jennifer teaches home cooks the secrets to cooking with bones. Each chapter of Bones includes stocks, soups, ribs, legs, and extremities (except for whole fish -- they don't have any). Many of the recipes are simple, with the inherent flavors of the bones doing most of the work. There are traditional, elegant dishes, such as Roasted Marrow Bones with Parsley Salad, Olive-Crusted Lamb Racks, and Crown Roast of Pork, as well as new takes on homestyle favorites, such as Maple Tomato Glazed Ribs, Coconut Chicken Curry, and Halibut Steaks with Orange Cream Sauce. Stunning, full-color photographs of dishes like Rabbit in Saffron Sauce with Spring Vegetables; Grilled Quail with Sage Butter; and Duck Legs with Cumin, Turnips, and Green Olives are sure to inspire.

To become rich, you will have to think radically differently from the way most people around you think. Do you know what those specific differences may be?

Women wrote books that idealized the very qualities that kept them powerless: timidity, piety, and a disdain for competition. Sentimental values that permeated popular literature continue to influence modern culture, preoccupied as it is with glamour, banal melodrama, and mindless consumption.

Like Galileo, who met a similar fate for similar reasons later in the century, Bruno has been accorded martyrdom to the cause of scientific truth and regarded as a visionary whose ideas were out of joint with the superstitions of his time. In fact, as editors Edward Gosselin and Lawrence Lerner point out, Bruno was far more complex, and his thought far more intricate, than simple stereotype would suggest. Possibly mad, certainly brilliant, vain, obstreperous, and often ignorant, Bruno was a Christian deeply immersed in Hermeticism and mysticism; simultaneously he was Copernican in his non-homocentric view of the universe. His La Cena de le ceneri was one of the first works in which Copernican theory was received outside the sphere of the natural sciences. These dialogues have never been generally accessible, and are translated into English as The Ash Wednesday Supper . Using Copernican theory as both a foundation of and a metaphor for his own vast philosophical-theological-political-social program, Bruno united his conflicting beliefs and frustrated his critics. Arguing for the physical reality of the infinite universe with no centre, yet whose centre is everywhere, Bruno sought to prove that each man is every other man. Using this radical cosmology and the imagery of Lenten regeneration, the messianic Bruno sought to heal the secular and religious wounds of sixteenth-century Europe by reconciling Catholic and Protestant, France and England. In this edition Gosselin and Lerner have provided a broad understanding of Bruno and his time, with background and interpretive discussion.

In 2014, the company's online transactions totaled $248 billion—more than those of Amazon and eBay combined. The first Chinese entrepreneur to appear on the cover of Forbes , Ma is the now the second-richest man in China, with a net worth that is estimated to be north of $29 billion.

Despite Ma's massive influence in China and in the global tech world, his inspirational rags-to-riches story is relatively unknown to the general American public. Never Give  Jack Ma In His Own Words is a comprehensive guide to the inner workings of arguably the most prominent figure in the global tech world in the past 20 years—comprised entirely of Ma's own thought-provoking and candid quotes.

When Ma decided to start his first Internet company in 1999, few Chinese people knew what the Internet was. Ma, a former English teacher, knew nothing about coding, and his $20,000 in startup funds were not made up of investments from venture capitalists but loans from his family. He channeled his startup experience into Alibaba, a group of websites that allows businesses and people to connect in order to buy and sell products (similar to eBay and Amazon) while also collecting advertising revenue (similar to Google). By some measures, Alibaba is now the largest e-commerce site in the world.

In this book, more than 200 quotes on business values, innovation, entrepreneurship, competition, management, teamwork, life, and more provide an intimate and direct look into the mind of this modern business icon and philanthropist. Many of these quotes are translated directly from the Chinese press and interviews. For readers who do not read Chinese and have no other access to these materials, this book provides invaluable insight into the mind of one of the world's most successful business magnates.","[""Business"",""Nonfiction"",""Biography"",""Philosophy"",""Leadership"",""Self Help"",""Economics"",""Finance"",""Entrepreneurship"",""Technology""]",7/12/2016,2016.0,"{""name"":""Jack  Ma"",""num_books"":1,""num_followers"":""20""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":23,""reviews_percentage"":4},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":46,""reviews_percentage"":8},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":168,""reviews_percentage"":32},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":158,""reviews_percentage"":30},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":123,""reviews_percentage"":23}}","""$3.20""",internal,internal_focus,False

O'Reilly""]",3.63,64,7.0,"Discover how the best companies win not by acquiring the right people - but by building the right organization. The 'war for talent' is one battle every company believes it should be waging. But while competitors are busy chasing after the same 'hot' individuals, smart companies are doing something infinitely more useful and far more difficult to copy - they're building organizations that make it possible for ordinary people at every desk and cubicle in their companies to perform as if they were stars. Blowing up the prevailing wisdom that companies must chase and acquire top talent in order to remain successful, ""Hidden Value"" argues instead that the source of sustained competitive advantage already exists within every organization. O'Reilly and Pfeffer, leading experts on organizational behavior and human resources, argue that how a firm creates and uses talent is far more important than how the firm attracts talent. The authors provide vivid, detailed case studies of several organizations in widely disparate industries - including Southwest Airlines, Cisco Systems, The Men's Wearhouse, and NUMMI - to illustrate how long-term success comes from value-driven, interrelated systems that align good people management with corporate strategy. In a refreshing break from management tomes that force-feed superficial frameworks and trite 'rules', the authors instead allow the company stories to take center stage. They guide readers in discovering for themselves how seven different firms maximize talent, why one firm hasn't fully released the hidden value in its work force, and, most importantly, how the winning companies have made it tough for competitors to imitate them. Collectively, the stories reveal a common path to success that places values before strategy, emphasizes implementation over planning, and focuses on getting the best out of all employees, not just individual stars. The authors also explore concerns or questions managers might have about how each company's experience parallels or conflicts with their own. Providing a rare opportunity for managers to actively participate in an invaluable learning process, ""Hidden Value"" offers a customizable template for building high-performance, people-centered organizations.","[""Business"",""Management"",""Leadership"",""Nonfiction""]",7/27/2000,2000.0,"{""name"":""Charles A.

Born into slavery, Harriet Tubman hears these words from God one summer night and decides to leave her husband and family behind and escape. Taking with her only her faith, she must creep through the woods with hounds at her feet, sleep for days in a potato hole, and trust people who could have easily turned her in. 

But she was never alone. 

In lyrical text, Carole Boston Weatherford describes Tubman's spiritual journey as she hears the voice of God guiding her north to freedom on that very first trip to escape the brutal practice of forced servitude. Tubman would make nineteen subsequent trips back south, never being caught, but none as profound as this first one. Courageous, compassionate, and deeply religious, Harriet Tubman, with her bravery and relentless pursuit of freedom, is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit.

Lincoln at Cooper Union explores Lincoln's most influential and widely reported pre-presidential address -- an extraordinary appeal by the western politician to the eastern elite that propelled him toward the Republican nomination for president. Delivered in New York in February 1860, the Cooper Union speech dispelled doubts about Lincoln's suitability for the presidency and reassured conservatives of his moderation while reaffirming his opposition to slavery to Republican progressives.

Award-winning Lincoln scholar Harold Holzer places Lincoln and his speech in the context of the times -- an era of racism, politicized journalism, and public oratory as entertainment -- and shows how the candidate framed the speech as an opportunity to continue his famous ""debates"" with his archrival Democrat Stephen A. Douglas on the question of slavery.

Holzer describes the enormous risk Lincoln took by appearing in New York, where he exposed himself to the country's most critical audience and took on Republican Senator William Henry Seward of New York, the front runner, in his own backyard. Then he recounts a brilliant and innovative public relations campaign, as Lincoln took the speech ""on the road"" in his successful quest for the presidency.","[""History"",""Civil War"",""Biography"",""American History"",""Nonfiction"",""Presidents"",""Politics"",""Us Presidents"",""American Civil War"",""Civil War History""]",4/27/2004,2004.0,"{""name"":""Harold Holzer"",""num_books"":116,""num_followers"":""67""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":16,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":26,""reviews_percentage"":2},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":128,""reviews_percentage"":13},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":319,""reviews_percentage"":34},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":427,""reviews_percentage"":46}}","""$15.99""",external,external_focus,True

Drawing upon untouched archives of documents and photographs and over 200 new interviews, Lillian Faderman and Stuart Timmons chart L.A.'s unique gay history, from the first missionary encounters with Native American cross-gendered ""two spirits"" to cross-dressing frontier women in search of their fortunes; from the bohemian freedom of early Hollywood to the explosion of gay life during World War II to the underground radicalism sparked by the 1950s blacklist; from the 1960s gay liberation movement to the creation of gay marketing in the 1990s. Faderman and Timmons show how geography, economic opportunity, and a constant influx of new people created a city that was more compatible to gay life than any other in America.

 Foreword by Barbara Kingsolver
 Essays by Jared Diamond, John W. Fitzpatrick, Lyanda Lynn Haupt, and Scott Weidensaul; 250 photographs.
 ""The birds sang us back to life]]""from the Foreword
 
 An intimate yet stunning exploration of North American species, The Living Bird shares our joyful and complex relationship with birds. Through imagery and thoughtful essays, award-winning photographer Gerrit Vyn, along with leading naturalists and bird enthusiasts, takes readers on a visual and experiential journey, revealing the essence of the century-long work done by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.
 
 Barbara Kingsolver remembers herself as a reluctant birder until, years later, she exalts in a special birding trip with her father. Scott Weidensaul dives into the secret lives of birds: How do flocks of birds manage to migrate thousands of miles? What determines who mates with whom? And what is the purpose of all those pretty feathers and glorious melodies? In her essay, Lyanda Lynn Haupt finds inspiration in our everyday birds as they connect us to the natural world. Director of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology John W. Fitzpatrick considers the threats birds face today, and some of the failuresand successesof the past. Jared Diamond underscores that it is in our hands to preserve the living birds around us.
 
 For 100 years, the Ithaca, NY-based Cornell Lab of Ornithology has researched the lives of birds, educating the public and striving for protection of species and habitat. But the Lab does more than just studyit celebrates birds through song and image, and connects people to birds, opening thousands of eyes to the natural world around us.","[""Birds"",""Nature"",""Photography"",""Nonfiction"",""Natural History"",""Art"",""Animals""]",10/1/2015,2015.0,"{""name"":""Gerrit Vyn"",""num_books"":8,""num_followers"":""1""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":2,""reviews_percentage"":2},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1,""reviews_percentage"":1},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1,""reviews_percentage"":1},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":18,""reviews_percentage"":21},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":63,""reviews_percentage"":74}}",,external,external_focus,False

Paxil. Zoloft. Turn on your television and you are likely to see a commercial for one of the many selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) on the market. We hear a lot about them, but do we really understand how these drugs work and what risks are involved for anyone who uses them?

Let Them Eat Prozac explores the history of SSRIs from their early development to their latest marketing campaigns and the controversies that surround them. Initially, they seemed like wonder drugs for those with mild to moderate depression patients take just one daily dose, and unlike the tranquilizers that were popular in the 1960s, they supposedly did not lead to addiction. When Prozac was released in the late 1980s, David Healy was among the psychiatrists who prescribed it. But he soon observed that some of these patients became agitated and even attempted suicide. Studies were soon published, citing numerous cases in which patients became anxious and reported increased suicidal thoughts while taking Prozac. Could the new wonder drug actually be making patients worse?

Healy draws on his own research and expertise to demonstrate the potential hazards associated with these drugs. He intersperses case histories with insider accounts of the research leading to the development and approval of SSRIs as a treatment for depression. Let Them Eat Prozac clearly demonstrates that the problems go much deeper than a disturbing side-effect of a particular drug. Current FDA regulations encourage drug companies to patent a specific compound and market it effectively to a large population on the basis of minimal effectiveness in a handful of trials.

The pharmaceutical industry would like us to believe that SSRIs can safely treat depression, anxiety, and a host of other mental problems. But as Let Them Eat Prozac reveals, this ""cure"" may be worse than the disease.","[""Psychology"",""Nonfiction"",""Mental Health"",""Science"",""History"",""Health"",""Psychiatry"",""Medical"",""Social Science"",""Counselling""]",8/18/2003,2003.0,"{""name"":""David Healy"",""num_books"":53,""num_followers"":""29""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":2,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":8,""reviews_percentage"":7},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":41,""reviews_percentage"":39},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":32,""reviews_percentage"":30},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":21,""reviews_percentage"":20}}","""$16.50""",external,external_focus,True

Taylor""]",3.72,101,7.0,"War has been one of the most destructive and decisive forces in world history.  But how do wars begin?  In this provocative book, the AJP Taylor addresses one of the greatest questions in history.  Taylor examines eight major conflicts, from the Napoleonic era to the Cold War, discussing the motives and personalities behind the decisions to go to war.  Some wars had a long background, whilst others were brought about by the overweening ambitions of a single man - Napoleon at the beginning of the period, Hitler towards the end. Public opinion, secret diplomacy, jingoism, armament manufacturers, and even historians, have all played a role in setting nation against nation.  But often, Taylor argues, the actual declaration of a war bears little relation to its profound cause. Wars in fact have sprung more from apprehension than from a lust for conquest. Every Great Power is suspicious of any likely or even unlikely rival. What seems defence to one will always appear as aggressive preparation to another.  'With nuclear weapons the Balance of Power has been replaced by the Balance of Terror,' writes Mr Taylor. 'This only means that the chances are less, not that they have been eliminated. In the old days the deterrent worked nine times out of ten. Now presumably it will work ninety-nine times out of a hundred. But if past experience is any guide, the hundredth occasion will come.'  'How Wars Begin' is a brilliant examination of one of the most challenging of all historical issues from one of the greatest historians of his generation.  'Anything Mr Taylor writes is worth reading ... he is our greatest popular historian since Macaulay' - The Spectator  'His informal, pithy style makes the book compelling - even exciting - reading' The Irish Times  A.J.P. Taylor (1906-90) was one of the most controversial historians of the twentieth century. He served as a lecturer at the Universities of Manchester, Oxford, and London. Taylor was significant both for the controversy his work on Germany and the Second World War engendered and for his role in the development of history on television. His books include 'War By Timetable' and ‘The War Lords’, also published in e-book by Endeavour Press.

Sir Karl discusses such issues as the aims of science, the role that it plays in our civilization, the moral responsibility of the scientist, the structure of history, and the perennial choice between reason and revolution. In doing so, he attacks intellectual fashions (like positivism) that exagerrate what science and rationality have done, as well as intellectual fashions (like relativism) that denigrate what science and rationality can do. Scientific knowledge, according to Popper, is one of the most rational and creative of human achievements, but it is also inherently fallible and subject to revision.
In place of intellectual fashions, Popper offers his own critical rationalism - a view that he regards both as a theory of knowlege and as an attitude towards human life, human morals and democracy.

Buford. As Buford, she single-handedly organized an Arkansas regiment; participated in the historic battles of Bull Run, Balls Bluff, Fort Donelson, and Shiloh; romanced men and women; and eventually decided that spying as a woman better suited her Confederate cause than fighting as a man. In the North, she posed as a double agent and worked to traffic information, drugs, and counterfeit bills to support the Confederate cause. She was even hired by the Yankee secret service to find ""the woman . . . traveling and figuring as a Confederate agent""—Velazquez herself.Originally published in 1876 as The Woman in Battle, this Civil War narrative offers Velazquez’s seemingly impossible autobiographical account, as well as a new critical introduction and glossary by Jesse Alemán. Scholars are divided between those who read the book as a generally honest autobiography and those who read it as mostly fiction. According to Alemán’s critical introduction, the book also reads as pulp fiction, spy memoir, seduction narrative, travel literature, and historical account, while it mirrors the literary conventions of other first-person female accounts of cross-dressing published in the United States during wartime, dating back to the Revolutionary War. Whatever the facts are, this is an authentic Civil War narrative, Alemán concludes, that recounts how war disrupts normal gender roles, redefines national borders, and challenges the definition of identity.","[""History"",""Civil War"",""Nonfiction"",""Autobiography"",""War"",""American History"",""American Civil War""]",1/1/1876,1876.0,"{""name"":""Loreta Janeta Velázquez"",""num_books"":13,""num_followers"":""2""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":2,""reviews_percentage"":3},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":6,""reviews_percentage"":10},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":14,""reviews_percentage"":24},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":17,""reviews_percentage"":29},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":19,""reviews_percentage"":32}}","""$14.20""",external,external_focus,False

Everything physical is made up of the elements and the infinite variety of molecules they form when they combine with each other. In Molecules , Theodore Gray takes the next step in the story that began with the periodic table in his best-selling book, The Elements: A Visual Exploration of Every Known Atom in the Universe . Here, he explores, through fascinating stories and trademark stunning photography, the most interesting, essential, useful, and beautiful of the millions of chemical structures that make up every material in the world.

Gray begins with an explanation of how atoms bond to form molecules and compounds, as well as the difference between organic and inorganic chemistry. He then goes on to explore the vast array of materials molecules can create, including: soaps and solvents; goops and oils; rocks and ores; ropes and fibers; painkillers and dangerous drugs; sweeteners; perfumes and stink bombs; colors and pigments; and controversial compounds including asbestos, CFCs, and thimerosal.

Big, gorgeous photographs, as well as diagrams of the compounds and their chemical bonds, rendered with never before seen beauty, fill the pages and capture molecules in their various states.

As he did in The Elements , Gray shows us molecules as we've never seen them before.

The book is divided into two  an interpretive section that concerns symbols in general and a ""dictionary"" that lists hundreds of symbols and explains their origins, their resemblances to other symbols, and the belief systems behind them. In the first section, Stevens takes the ideas of C. G. Jung a stage further, asserting not only that we possess an innate symbol-forming propensity that exists as a creative and integral part of our psychic make-up, but also that the human mind evolved this capacity as a result of selection pressures encountered by our species in the course of its evolutionary history.

Progressive reforms around the turn of the century reduced the power of parties and increased the role of education, making way for the ""informed citizen,"" which remains the ideal in American civic life. Today a fourth model, ""the rights-bearing citizen,"" supplements the ""informed citizen"" model and makes the courthouse as well as the voting booth a channel for citizenship.","[""History"",""Politics"",""Nonfiction"",""American History"",""Academic""]",9/20/1998,1998.0,"{""name"":""Michael Schudson"",""num_books"":46,""num_followers"":""11""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1,""reviews_percentage"":1},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":14,""reviews_percentage"":20},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":34,""reviews_percentage"":49},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":19,""reviews_percentage"":27}}",,external,internal_focus,True

Cody with the American West. This autobiography, infused with the drama of dime novels and stage melodramas that would transform the author into an American icon, recounts a boy’s move to the Kansas territory, where his father hoped to homestead, and his subsequent life on the frontier, following his career from trapper to buffalo hunter to Army scout, guide, and Indian fighter. Written when Cody was thirty-three years old, this life story captures both the hard reality of frontier life and the sensational image to which a boy of the time might aspire: the Indian fights, buffalo hunting, and Pony Express escapades that popular history contributed to the myth-making of Buffalo Bill. It is this movement between the personal and the mythic, plain facts and tall tales, William F. Cody and Buffalo Bill, that gives this autobiography its fascination and its power. Based on the original 1879 edition, this volume provides a new introduction, historical materials, and twenty-six additional images. It reveals both the William F. Cody of personal history and the Buffalo Bill of American mythology—and, finally, the curious reality that partakes of both.

Indeed, in the Tibetan and East Asian traditions, Nagarjuna is often referred to as the 'second Buddha.' His primary contribution to Buddhist thought lies is in the further development of the concept of sunyata or 'emptiness.' For Nagarjuna, all phenomena are without any svabhaba, literally 'own-nature' or 'self-nature', and thus without any underlying essence. In this book, Jan Westerhoff offers a systematic account of Nagarjuna's philosophical position. He reads Nagarjuna in his own philosophical context, but he does not hesitate to show that the issues of Indian and Tibetan Buddhist philosophy have at least family resemblances to issues in European philosophy.","[""Buddhism"",""Philosophy"",""Religion"",""Nonfiction"",""India""]",1/21/2009,2009.0,"{""name"":""Jan Westerhoff"",""num_books"":13,""num_followers"":""36""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":0,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1,""reviews_percentage"":0},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":19,""reviews_percentage"":18},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":41,""reviews_percentage"":39},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":43,""reviews_percentage"":41}}","""$19.79""",external,external_focus,False

Heston Blumenthal, whose name is synonymous with cutting-edge cuisine, nonetheless finds his greatest source of inspiration in the unique and delicious food that the sceptered isle once produced. This has been the secret to his success at world-famous restaurants The Fat Duck and Dinner, where a contrast between old and new, modern and historic, is key. Historic Blumenthal charts a quest for identity through the best of British cooking that stretches from medieval to late-Victorian recipes. Start with thirty historic dishes, take them apart, put them together again, and what have you got? A sublime twenty-first-century take on delicacies including meat fruit (1500), quaking pudding (1660), and mock-turtle soup (1892). Heston examines the history behind each one’s invention and the science that makes it work. He puts these dishes in their social context and follows obscure culinary trails, ferreting out such curious sources as The Queen-like Closet from 1672 (which offers an excellent method for drying goose). What it adds up to is an idiosyncratic culinary history of Britain.This glorious tome also gives a unique insight into the way that Heston works, with signature dishes from both The Fat Duck and Dinner.

What has gone unnoticed about the much-researched life of Washington is that he was in fact a consummate politician, as historian John Ferling shows in this revealing and provocative new book. As leader of the Continental Army, Washington's keen political savvy enabled him not only to outwit superior British forces, but--even more challenging--to manage the fractious and intrusive Continental Congress. Despite dire setbacks early in the war, Washington deftly outmaneuvered rival generals and defused dissent from officers below him, ending the war with the status of a national icon. His carefully burnished reputation allowed Washington, as president, to lead the country under the guise of non-partisanship for almost all of his eight years in office.

We keep delaying our happiness until things are just right in our life. We think we will be happy in the future and then wonder why we are not happy now. Happiness is only possible when we are able to accept everyone as they are, at every moment, in every situation. That means an end to judging or resisting others, an end to complaining and blaming, an end to criticizing and controlling and an end to competing with anyone. Happiness means the awakening and acceptance of self responsibility. It is only when we choose thoughts and feelings that are aligned with our true nature of purity, peace and love that we can shift - from asking to sharing, from holding on to letting go, from expectations to acceptance, from the past and the future to being in the now.

But the organization that changed the face of terrorism forever and unleashed a whirlwind of counterterrorism activity and two major wars had been on the scene long before that eventful morning. In Al Qaeda, the Islamic State, and the Global Jihadist Movement: What Everyone Needs to Know, Daniel L. Byman, an eminent scholar of Middle East terrorism and international security who served on the 9/11 Commission, provides a sharp and concise overview of Al Qaeda, from its humble origins in the mountains of Afghanistan to the present, explaining its perseverance and adaptation since 9/11 and the limits of U.S. and allied counterterrorism efforts. The organization that would come to be known as Al Qaeda traces its roots to the anti-Soviet jihad in Afghanistan in the 1980s. Founded as the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan, Al Qaeda achieved a degree of international notoriety with a series of spectacular attacks in the 1990s; however, it was the dramatic assaults on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on 9/11 that truly launched Al Qaeda onto the global stage. The attacks endowed the organization with world-historical importance and provoked an overwhelming counterattack by the United States and other western countries. Within a year of 9/11, the core of Al Qaeda had been chased out of Afghanistan and into a variety of refuges across the Muslim world. Splinter groups and franchised offshoots were active in the 2000s in countries like Pakistan, Iraq, and Yemen, but by early 2011, after more than a decade of relentless counterterrorism efforts by the United States and other Western military and intelligence services, most felt that Al Qaedas moment had passed. With the death of Osama bin Laden in May of that year, many predicted that Al Qaeda was in its death throes. Shockingly, Al Qaeda has staged a remarkable comeback in the last few years. In almost every conflict in the Muslim world, from portions of the Xanjing region in northwest China to the African subcontinent, Al Qaeda franchises or like-minded groups have played a role. Al Qaedas extreme Salafist ideology continues to appeal to radicalized Sunni Muslims throughout the world, and it has successfully altered its organizational structure so that it can both weather Americas enduring full-spectrum assault and tailor its message to specific audiences. Authoritative and highly readable, Bymans account offers readers insightful and penetrating answers to the fundamental questions about Al Qaeda: who they are, where they came from, where theyre going-and, perhaps most critically-what we can do about it.

For two decades, historian Alice Dreger has led a life of extraordinary engagement, combining activist service to victims of unethical medical research with defense of scientists whose work has outraged identity politics activists. With spirit and wit, Dreger offers in Galileo’s Middle Finger an unforgettable vision of the importance of rigorous truth seeking in today’s America, where both the free press and free scholarly inquiry struggle under dire economic and political threats.This illuminating chronicle begins with Dreger’s own research into the treatment of people born intersex (once called hermaphrodites). Realization of the shocking surgical and ethical abuses conducted in the name of “normalizing” intersex children’s gender identities moved Dreger to become an internationally recognized patient rights’ activist. But even as the intersex rights movement succeeded, Dreger began to realize how some fellow progressive activists were employing lies and personal attacks to silence scientists whose data revealed uncomfortable truths about humans. In researching one such case, Dreger suddenly became the target of just these kinds of attacks.Troubled, she decided to try to understand more—to travel the country to ferret out the truth behind various controversies, to obtain a global view of the nature and costs of these battles. Galileo’s Middle Finger describes Dreger’s long and harrowing journeys between the two camps for which she felt equal empathy: social justice activists determined to win and researchers determined to put hard truths before comfort. Ultimately what emerges is a lesson about the intertwining of justice and of truth—and a lesson of the importance of responsible scholars and journalists to our fragile democracy.","[""Science"",""Nonfiction"",""History"",""Politics"",""Philosophy"",""Biography"",""Sociology"",""Medicine"",""Psychology"",""Memoir""]",3/10/2015,2015.0,"{""name"":""Alice Domurat Dreger"",""num_books"":8,""num_followers"":""92""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":82,""reviews_percentage"":3},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":165,""reviews_percentage"":7},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":526,""reviews_percentage"":25},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":774,""reviews_percentage"":37},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":544,""reviews_percentage"":26}}","""$14.99""",external,external_focus,True

Many churches do not develop leaders intentionally and consistently. When leaders emerge from some churches, it is often by accident. Something is missing. Something is off.

Authors Eric Geiger (author of bestselling Simple Church and Creature of the Word ) and Kevin Peck argue that churches that consistently produce leaders have a strong conviction to develop leaders, a healthy culture for leadership development, and helpful constructs to systematically and intentionally build leaders. All three are essential for leaders to be formed through the ministry of a local church.

From the first recordings of history God has made it clear that He has designed creation to be led by His covenant people. More than that, He has decided what His people are to do with that leadership. Whether you are called to lead your home, in the marketplace, in God’s church, or in your community, if you are called by God you are called to lead others to worship the glory of God in Jesus Christ.

The story of information begins in a time profoundly unlike our own, when every thought and utterance vanishes as soon as it is born. From the invention of scripts and alphabets to the long-misunderstood talking drums of Africa, Gleick tells the story of information technologies that changed the very nature of human consciousness. He provides portraits of the key figures contributing to the inexorable development of our modern understanding of information: Charles Babbage, the idiosyncratic inventor of the first great mechanical computer; Ada Byron, the brilliant and doomed daughter of the poet, who became the first true programmer; pivotal figures like Samuel Morse and Alan Turing; and Claude Shannon, the creator of information theory itself. 

And then the information age arrives. Citizens of this world become experts willy-nilly: aficionados of bits and bytes.

Taking us to the ghosts of summers past and to other battles from other times, he draws out the story of Sri Lanka today-an exhausted, disturbed society, still hot from the embers of the war.

Just Who Will You Be is a candid, heartfelt, and inspirational book for seekers of all ages. Inspired by a speech she gave, Maria Shriver's message is that what you do in your life isn't what matters. It's who you are. It's an important lesson that will appeal to anyone of any age looking for a life of meaning.

In her own life, Shriver always walked straight down her own distinctive path, achieving her childhood goal of becoming ""award-winning network newswoman Maria Shriver"". But when her husband was elected California's Governor and she suddenly had to leave her job at NBC News, Maria was thrown for a loop. Right about then, her nephew asked her to speak at his high school graduation. She resisted, wondering how she could possibly give advice to kids, when she was feeling so lost herself. But in the end she relented and decided to dig down and dig deep, and the result is this little jewel.

She wants help and healing.
She wants to hear and be heard, to see and be seen.
She wants things set right.
 
She wants to know what is true—not partly true, or sometimes true, or almost true. She wants to see Truth itself, face-to-face. But here, now, these things are all cloudy. Hope is tinged with hurt. Faith is shaded by doubt. Lesser, broken things masquerade as love.
 
How does she find something permanent when the world around her is always changing, when not even she can stay the same? And if she finds it, how does she hold on?  
 
She Reads Truth tells the stories of two women who discovered, through very different lives and circumstances, that only God and His Word remain unchanged as the world around them shifted and slipped away. Infused with biblical application and Scripture, this book is not just about two characters in two stories, but about one Hero and one Story. Every image points to the bigger picture—that God and His Word are true. Not because of anything we do, but because of who He is. Not once, not occasionally, but right now and all the time.
 
Sometimes it takes everything moving to notice the thing that doesn’t move. Sometimes it takes telling two very different stories to notice how the Truth was exactly the same in both of them.

For anyone searching for a solid foundation to cling to, She Reads Truth is a rich and honest Bible-filled journey to finally find permanent in a world that’s passing away.

The political order was always tied to an official religion in Christian Europe, pre-Christian Europe, and in the Arabic world. But from the eighteenth century
onwards, some European states began to set up their political order on a different basis. Not religion, but the rule of law through non-religious values embedded in constitutions became the foundation of some states -- a movement we now call secularism. In others, a de facto secularism emerged as
political values and civil and criminal law altered their professed foundation from a shared religion to a non-religious basis.

Today secularism is an increasingly hottopic in public, political, and religious debate across the globe. It is embodied in the conflict between secular republics -- from the US to India -- and the challenges they face from resurgent religious identity politics; in the challenges faced by religious
states like those of the Arab world from insurgent secularists; and in states like China where calls for freedom of belief are challenging a state imposed non-religious worldview. In this short introduction Andrew Copson tells the story of secularism, taking in momentous episodes in world history,
such as the great transition of Europe from religious orthodoxy to pluralism, the global struggle for human rights and democracy, and the origins of modernity. He also considers the role of secularism when engaging with some of the most contentious political and legal issues of our

This approach has its merit in allowing you to learn two crazy facts about people, places or animals by answering a single question. The book is not meant to be ""your go-to"" book for facts. I assure you however that it is loaded with fun and verified facts presented in a manner that can provide you with hours of entertainment.

In medical school, Matt McCarthy dreamed of being a different kind of doctor—the sort of mythical, unflappable physician who could reach unreachable patients. But when a new admission to the critical care unit almost died his first night on call, he found himself scrambling. Visions of mastery quickly gave way to hopes of simply surviving hospital life, where confidence was hard to come by and no amount of med school training could dispel the terror of facing actual patients.

This funny, candid memoir of McCarthy’s intern year at a New York hospital provides a scorchingly frank look at how doctors are made, taking readers into patients’ rooms and doctors’ conferences to witness a physician's journey from ineptitude to competence. McCarthy's one stroke of luck paired him with a brilliant second-year adviser he called “Baio” (owing to his resemblance to the Charles in Charge star), who proved to be a remarkable teacher with a wicked sense of humor. McCarthy would learn even more from the people he cared for, including a man named Benny, who was living in the hospital for months at a time awaiting a heart transplant. But no teacher could help McCarthy when an accident put his own health at risk, and showed him all too painfully the thin line between doctor and patient.

Penny Kittle wants us to face the hard truths every English teacher fears: too many kids don't read the assigned texts, and some even manage to slip by without having ever read a single book by the time they graduate. As middle and high school reading declines, college professors lament students' inability to comprehend and analyze complex texts, while the rest of us wonder: what do we lose as a society when so many of our high school graduates have no interest in reading anything?In Book Love Penny takes student apathy head on, first by recognizing why students don't read and then showing us that when we give kids books that are right for them, along with time to read and regular response to their thinking, we can create a pathway to satisfying reading that leads to more challenging literature and ultimately, a love of reading. With a clear eye on the reality of today's classrooms, Penny provides practical strategies and advice on:


increasing volume, capacity, and complexity over time creating a balance of independent reading, text study, and novel study helping students deepen their thinking through writing about reading building a classroom library with themes that matter to 21st century kids. Book Love is a call to arms for putting every single kid, no exceptions allowed, on a personal reading journey. But much more than that, it's a powerful reminder of why we became English teachers in the first place: our passion for books. Books matter. Stories heal. The right book in the hands of a kid can change a life forever. We can't wait for anyone else to teach our students a love of books-it's up to us and the time is now. If not you, who?

Wouldn't they?"" Gretchen Bernabei and Dorothy Hall In their signature easy-to-implement style, Gretchen Bernabei and Dorothy Hall offer new options for teaching expository writing that more realistically match the way readers actually think and writers actually write. While many state assessments as well as the Common Core ask students to write about their opinions, the goal in The Story of My Thinking is to help teachers take their kids through the various stages of the writing process (from generating ideas to publication) in a way that breaks down the barrier between ""academic"" writing and ""creative"" writing and helps kids produce vibrant nonfiction with voice and conviction. The Story of My Thinking provides 13 writing activities for familiar teaching situations, with step-by-step lessons that help you bridge the gap between narrative and informative writing. Using the same classroom-tested strategies that made Crunchtime a bestseller, the authors give the flexibility of dipping in and out of the lessons as you need them. For example, ""If you want them to explore topics for deep development and systemic growth,"" use Gretchen's ""Inner Streams/Gritty Life"" activity along with the tools that help students plan their thinking. Choose the lesson that matches your teaching situation today, and then another one tomorrow. When authentic, personal experiences replace canned, pre-written topics, and students are provided with structures that reflect how readers read, their writing transforms from formulaic to passionate. And when students have plenty of chances to write about topics that are meaningful to them, in a variety of ways, for a variety of situations, then they will be ready for any writing assignment.","[""Teaching"",""Writing"",""Nonfiction"",""Education""]",9/30/2012,2012.0,"{""name"":""Dorothy N Hall"",""num_books"":1}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":0,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1,""reviews_percentage"":1},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":10,""reviews_percentage"":13},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":26,""reviews_percentage"":34},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":39,""reviews_percentage"":51}}",,external,internal_focus,True

The Internet has been hailed as an unprecedented democratizing force, a place where all can be heard and everyone can participate equally. But how true is this claim? In a seminal dismantling of techno-utopian visions, ""The People's Platform"" argues that for all that we ""tweet"" and ""like"" and ""share,"" the Internet in fact reflects and amplifies real-world inequities at least as much as it ameliorates them. Online, just as off-line, attention and influence largely accrue to those who already have plenty of both.

What we have seen so far, Astra Taylor says, has been not a revolution but a rearrangement. Although Silicon Valley tycoons have eclipsed Hollywood moguls, a handful of giants like Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook remain the gatekeepers. And the worst habits of the old media model--the pressure to seek easy celebrity, to be quick and sensational above all--have proliferated online, where ""aggregating"" the work of others is the surest way to attract eyeballs and ad revenue. When culture is ""free,"" creative work has diminishing value, and advertising fuels the system. The new order looks suspiciously like the old one.

We can do better, Taylor insists. The online world does offer a unique opportunity, but a democratic culture that supports diverse voices and work of lasting value will not spring up from technology alone. If we want the Internet to truly be a people's platform, we will have to make it so.","[""Nonfiction"",""Technology"",""Politics"",""Sociology"",""Internet"",""Society"",""Business"",""Science"",""Cultural"",""Economics""]",10/2/2012,2012.0,"{""name"":""Astra Taylor"",""num_books"":26,""num_followers"":""167""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":10,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":26,""reviews_percentage"":4},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":101,""reviews_percentage"":16},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":258,""reviews_percentage"":43},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":202,""reviews_percentage"":33}}","""$6.64""",external,external_focus,True

One hot mid-summer morning in Toronto, bestselling crime novelist Howard Engel got up to fetch his morning paper and discovered he could no longer read it. The letters had mysteriously jumbled themselves into something that looked like Cyrillic one moment and Korean the next. ""Was this a Serbo-Croatian version of The Globe?"" he wondered. Overnight, while he slept, Engel had experienced a stroke and now suffered from a rare condition called alexia sine agraphia, meaning that while he could still write, he could no longer read. Engel's gentle humour and matter-of- fact tone set the stage for this extraordinary memoir that traces the writer's journey through a life-changing episode. Describing his stay in hospital, Engel also discovers other horrifying and fascinating new ""insults"" to his brain: Geography eludes him; he can no longer navigate.

Apples and grapefruit now look the same (only by smelling each one can he tell them apart). And yet, despite these devastating disabilities and the almost certain loss of his career and a huge chunk of his identity, Engel prepares to reconcile with his condition. He contacts renowned neurologist Dr. Oliver Sacks for advice, forging a lasting friendship. He bravely begins to learn how to read all over again. And, in the face of obstacles, his imagination triumphs in the writing of his latest Benny Cooperman detective novel, Memory Book. Engel describes the painstaking writing process of this 2005 bestseller, which has the detective developing alexia after being struck on the head.

We will directly and indirectly determine what lives, what dies, where, and when. We are in a different phase of evolution; the future of life is now in our hands.” Why are rates of conditions like autism, asthma, obesity, and allergies exploding at an unprecedented pace? Why are humans living longer, getting smarter, and having far fewer kids? How might your lifestyle affect your unborn children and grandchildren? How will gene-editing technologies like CRISPR steer the course of human evolution? If Darwin were alive today, how would he explain this new world? Could our progeny eventually become a different species—or several? In Evolving Ourselves , futurist Juan Enriquez and scientist Steve Gullans conduct a sweeping tour of how humans are changing the course of evolution—sometimes intentionally, sometimes not. For 
   •  Globally, rates of obesity in humans nearly doubled between 1980 and 2014. What’s more, there’s evidence that other species, from pasture-fed horses to lab animals to house cats, are also getting fatter.
   •  As reported by U.S. government agencies, the rate of autism rose by 131 percent from 2001 to 2010, an increase that cannot be attributed simply to increases in diagnosis rates.
   •  Three hundred years ago, almost no one with a serious nut allergy lived long enough to reproduce. Today, despite an environment in which food allergies have increased by 50 percent in just over a decade, 17 million Americans who suffer from food allergies survive, thrive, and pass their genes and behaviors on to the next generation.
   •  In the pre-Twinkie era, early humans had quite healthy mouths. As we began cooking, bathing, and using antibiotics, the bacteria in our bodies changed dramatically and became far less diverse. Today the consequences are evident not only in our teeth but throughout our bodies and minds. 
Though these harbingers of change are deeply unsettling, the authors argue that we are also in an epoch of tremendous opportunity. New advances in biotechnology help us mitigate the cruel forces of natural selection, from saving prematurely born babies to gene therapies for sickle cell anemia and other conditions. As technology like CRISPR enables us to take control of our genes, we will be able to alter our own species and many others—a good thing, given that our eventual survival will require space travel and colonization, enabled by a fundamental redesign of our bodies. Future humans could become great caretakers of the planet, as well as a more diverse, more resilient, gentler, and more intelligent species—but only if we make the right choices now.

Plutarco cita gli antichi filosofi, racconta aneddoti, riporta versi di Omero, mette in guardia contro le belle parole vuote, contro i discorsi apparentemente affascinanti ma privi di sostanza, usati per abbindolare gli ingenui e coloro, appunto, che non sanno ascoltare.","[""Philosophy"",""Nonfiction"",""Classics"",""Self Help""]",1/1/100,,"{""name"":""Plutarch"",""num_books"":3673,""num_followers"":""790""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":0,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":10,""reviews_percentage"":5},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":63,""reviews_percentage"":32},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":72,""reviews_percentage"":37},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":47,""reviews_percentage"":24}}","""$2.99""",internal,external_focus,False

From extensive archival materials and interviews with well-known Italian Americans, Maria Laurino strips away stereotypes and nostalgia to tell the complicated, centuries-long story of the true Italian-American experience. Looking beyond the familiar Little Italys and stereotypes fostered by The Godfather and The Sopranos , Laurino reveals surprising, fascinating lives: Italian-Americans working on sugar-cane plantations in Louisiana to those who were lynched in New Orleans; the banker who helped rebuild San Francisco after the great earthquake; families interned as “enemy aliens” in World War II. From anarchist radicals to “Rosie the Riveter” to Nancy Pelosi, Andrew Cuomo, and Bill de Blasio; from traditional artisans to rebel songsters like Frank Sinatra, Dion, Madonna, and Lady Gaga, this book is both exploration and celebration of the rich legacy of Italian-American life. Readers can discover the history chronologically, chapter by chapter, or serendipitously by exploring the trove of supplemental materials.

And it remains there, all of the complexity, beauty, and intrigue that Hemingway described in the pages of so much of his work.It is all still there for the reader and traveler to experience—the history, the streets, and the city. Restaurants, hotels, homes, sites and favorite bars are all detailed here. The ninety-five black and white photographs in Hemingway’s Paris are of the highest caliber. The accompanying text reveals Wheeler’s deep understanding of the man; his torment, talent, obstacles and the places of refuge needed to nurture one of the preeminent writers of the twentieth century. Moved by the humanistic writing of the man—a writer capable of transcending his readers to foreign settings and into the hearts and minds of his protagonists—Wheeler was inspired to travel throughout France, Italy, Spain, Africa, and Cuba, where he has sought to gain insight into the motivation behind Hemingway’s books and short stories. As a teacher, lecturer, and photojournalist, he set out to capture and interpret the Paris that Ernest Hemingway experienced in the first part of the century. Through his journal and photographs, Wheeler portrays the intimate connection Hemingway had with the woman he never stopped loving, Hadley, and with the city he loved most, Paris.","[""Nonfiction"",""Travel"",""History"",""Biography"",""Photography"",""France"",""Books About Books""]",4/7/2015,2015.0,"{""name"":""Robert  Wheeler"",""num_books"":4,""num_followers"":""33""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":4,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":19,""reviews_percentage"":8},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":64,""reviews_percentage"":29},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":61,""reviews_percentage"":28},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":69,""reviews_percentage"":31}}","""$14.99""",external,external_focus,True

Hyde describes the Communist mechanics of instilling dedication, the first prerequisite for leadership. Here is the complete rationale of party technique: how to stimulate the willingness to sacrifice; the advisibility of making big demands to insure a big response; the inspirational indoctrination; and the subtle conversion methods. In this small book, so large with implications, Douglas Hyde comments on both Communist and Catholic potential and their lack of maximum effectiveness. He advocates positive Catholic action, not just a negative anti-Communism, and he points out that the guidelines are now down for a decisive choice between total Communism and a total Christianity. Here is a realistic approach to an acute problem uncolored by emotional propaganda, and here is a realistic answer on how to inspire dedication for leadership.","[""Leadership"",""Politics"",""Christian"",""Nonfiction"",""History"",""Christian Living"",""Philosophy"",""Social Science"",""Government"",""Christianity""]",1/1/1956,1956.0,"{""name"":""Douglas Arnold Hyde"",""num_books"":21,""num_followers"":""7""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":7,""reviews_percentage"":2},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":41,""reviews_percentage"":15},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":109,""reviews_percentage"":41},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":102,""reviews_percentage"":39}}","""$11.99""",external,internal_focus,True

The second-largest city in South America, it has been the home of such renowned cultural and historical figures as Jorge Luis Borges and Astor Piazzola, Che Guevara and Eva Peron. Like every truly great city, New York, London and Prague; Buenos Aires is its own universe, with its own center of gravity, its own scents and flavors, its own architectural signature-in short, its own way of being. From San Telmo's oak-paneled restaurants and brightly tiled apothecaries from 1900, and the phantasmagoric Beaux Arts palaces along Avenida Alvear and Plaza San Martin, to the parks of Palermo and the bustling bars and cafes along Corrientes and LaValle, Buenos Aires is steeped in exotic culture and history.

In Buenos Aires,  Art and culture critic James Gardner offers a colorful biography of the ""Paris of the South,"" from its origins and time as a colonial city, through its Golden age, the rise of Peron, and the Falklands War, to the present day. With entertaining asides about art, architecture, literature, food and dance, as well as local customs and colorful personalities, this is a rich and unique historical narrative of Buenos Aires.

Skepticism, pessimism, and suspicion of happy talk are the true characteristics of an authentically conservative temperament. And from Hobbes and Burke through Lord Salisbury and Calvin Coolidge, up to Pat Buchanan and Mark Steyn in our own time, these beliefs have kept the human race from blindly chasing its utopian dreams right off a cliff.

Recently, though, various comforting yet fundamentally idiotic notions of political correctness and wishful thinking have taken root beyond the ""Kumbaya""-singing, we're-all-one crowd. These ideas have now infected conservatives, the very people who really should know better. The Republican Party has been derailed by legions of fools and poseurs wearing smiley-face masks.

Think rescuing the economy by condemning our descendents to lives of spirit-crushing debt. Think nation-building abroad while we slowly disintegrate at home. Think education and No Child Left Behind. . . . But don't think about it too much, because if you do, you'll quickly come to the logical  We are doomed.

Need more convincing? Dwell on the cheerful promises of the diversity cult and the undeniable reality of the oncoming demographic disaster. Contemplate the feminization of everything, or take a good look at what passes for art these days. Witness the rise of culturism and the death of religion. Bow down before your new master, the federal apparatchik. Finally, ask  How certain am I that the United States of America will survive, in any recognizable form, until, say, 2022?

A scathing, mordantly funny romp through today's dismal and dismaler political and cultural scene, We Are Doomed provides a long-overdue dose of reality, revealing just how the GOP has been led astray in recent years–and showing that had conservatives held on to their fittingly pessimistic outlook, America's future would be far brighter.

Pinar""]",3.66,92,9.0,"This primer for teachers (prospective and practicing) asks students to question the historical present and their relation to it, and in so doing, to construct their own understandings of what it means to teach, to study, to become ""educated."" Curriculum theory is presented as the interdisciplinary study of educational experience. The mentral concept of curriculum studies as a ""complicated conversation"" is explored.

Within this framework, Pinar offers a compelling interpretation of contemporary ""school reform"" policies and practices, and an explication of curriculum theory's power to bring forth understanding, resistance, and change. His argument is  Public education today is dominated by a conservative agenda based on a business model of education focused on the ""bottom line"" (test scores). The origins of this agenda go back to the 1950s, when gendered anxieties over the Cold War and racialized anxieties over school desegregation coded public education (not for the first time) as ""feminized"" and ""black."" The nature of many politicians' and some parents' criticisms of public education is intelligible only as a recoding of these gendered and racialized anxieties, deferred and displaced from their originating events onto ""school reform."" This has rendered the classroom a privatized and racialized domestic sphere which politicians--mostly (white) men--endeavor to control, disguised by apparently commonsense claims of ""accountability."" What is dangerously at stake is academic freedom and control of the curriculum--what teachers are permitted to teach, what children are permitted to study.

This text offers both an understanding of the problem and a way to address it. Pinar uses the concept of currere --the Latin infinitive of curriculum--to describe an autobiographical method that provides a strategy for self-study, a way for both individuals and groups to understand their situations, leading to action. Through currere , it is possible for educators to begin to reconstruct the public sphere--now a ""shopping mall"" in which citizens and students have been reduced to consumers--by connecting academic knowledge to their students (and their own) subjectivities, to society, and to the historical moment. In doing so, they can take back (relative) intellectual freedom and rebuild schooling to speak to persisting problems of race, class, and gender.

Jung and gain insight into why others behave the way they do, and why you are the person you are.  

What’s your type?

Would you rather . . .
. . . celebrate with the whole crowd or just a few friends?
. . . focus on the facts or get an overall impression?
. . . go with what “seems logical” or what “feels fair”?
. . . keep to a schedule or keep your options open?
 
How you answer these questions is the very beginning of understanding who you are and how you relate to those around you, by using a new and exciting method called Typewatching. Otto Kroeger and Janet M. Thuesen have developed Typewatching from the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, which was derived from the work of C. G. Jung. Now they have put together the first and only popular guide to the MBTI in Type Talk . Here is a one-of-a-kind guide that describes this scientifically validated approach to “name-calling,” a method that has been used for more than forty years by individuals, families, corporations, and governments who want to communicate better.

Typewatching as explained in Type Talk is easy to learn and natural to use. With even moderate practice it can help teachers teach and students learn, workers work and bosses boss. It can help lovers love, parents parent, and everyone accept themselves and others more easily. Best of all, Typewatching is fun.
 
Type Talk examines the four pairs of preferences that are fundamental to every personality type: Extraversion/Introversion, Sensing/iNtuition, Thinking/Feeling, and Judging/Perceiving. Kroeger and Thuesen provide a self-evaluation that can be used to determine which of each of these preferences best describes you. They delineate every combination of preferences—there are 16 different personality types, so you are sure to find yourself—and they go on to demonstrate how to analyze and evaluate other people as well. Once armed with this knowledge, you will learn how to thrive in a world of so many different types. Here is a celebration of the similarities and differences in people, an odyssey of discovery in which the final destination is success, satisfaction, and serenity.","[""Psychology"",""Nonfiction"",""Self Help"",""Business"",""Personal Development"",""Reference"",""Leadership"",""Relationships"",""Communication"",""Counselling""]",1/1/1988,1988.0,"{""name"":""Otto Kroeger"",""num_books"":14,""num_followers"":""14""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":23,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":74,""reviews_percentage"":3},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":428,""reviews_percentage"":22},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":702,""reviews_percentage"":36},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":715,""reviews_percentage"":36}}","""$10.99""",internal,internal_focus,False

Decades later, when he was well over fifty, Leigh Fermor told the story of that life-changing journey in A Time of Gifts and Between the Woods and the Water, two books now celebrated as among the most vivid, absorbing, delightful, and beautifully-written travel books of all time.The Broken Road is the long and avidly awaited account of the final leg of his youthful adventure that Leigh Fermor promised but was unable to finish before his death in 2011. Assembled from Leigh Fermor’s manuscripts by his prize-winning biographer Artemis Cooper and the travel writer Colin Thubron, this is perhaps the most personal of all Leigh Fermor’s books, catching up with young Paddy in the fall of 1934 and following him through Bulgaria and Rumania to the coast of the Black Sea. Days and nights on the road, spectacular landscapes and uncanny cities, friendships lost and found, leading the high life in Bucharest or camping out with fishermen and shepherds: in the The Broken Road such incidents and escapades are described with all the linguistic bravura, odd and astonishing learning, and overflowing exuberance that Leigh Fermor is famous for, but also with a melancholy awareness of the passage of time, especially when he meditates on the  scarred history of the Balkans or on his troubled relations with his father. The book ends, perfectly, with Paddy’s diary from the winter of 1934, when he had reached Greece, the country he would fall in love with and fight for: across the space of three quarters of century we can still hear the ringing voice of an irrepressible young man embarking on a life of adventure.","[""Travel"",""Nonfiction"",""History"",""Memoir"",""Biography"",""Greece"",""Walking"",""Autobiography"",""Bulgaria"",""Romania""]",9/12/2013,2013.0,"{""name"":""Patrick Leigh Fermor"",""num_books"":50,""num_followers"":""515""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":6,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":31,""reviews_percentage"":1},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":204,""reviews_percentage"":12},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":642,""reviews_percentage"":40},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":696,""reviews_percentage"":44}}","""$11.99""",external,external_focus,True

In the midst of a normal life, Katie became increasingly depressed, and over a ten-year period sank further into rage, despair, and thoughts of suicide. Then one morning, she woke up in a state of absolute joy, filled with the realization of how her own suffering had ended. The freedom of that realization has never left her, and now in Loving What Is you can discover the same freedom through The Work.

The Work is simply four questions that, when applied to a specific problem, enable you to see what is troubling you in an entirely different light. As Katie says, “It’s not the problem that causes our suffering; it’s our thinking about the problem.” Contrary to popular belief, trying to let go of a painful thought never works; instead, once we have done The Work, the thought lets go of us. At that point, we can truly love what is, just as it is.

Loving What Is will show you step-by-step, through clear and vivid examples, exactly how to use this revolutionary process for yourself. You’ll see people do The Work with Katie on a broad range of human problems, from a wife ready to leave her husband because he wants more sex, to a Manhattan worker paralyzed by fear of terrorism, to a woman suffering over a death in her family. Many people have discovered The Work’s power to solve problems; in addition, they say that through The Work they experience a sense of lasting peace and find the clarity and energy to act, even in situations that had previously seemed impossible.

If you continue to do The Work, you may discover, as many people have, that the questioning flows into every aspect of your life, effortlessly undoing the stressful thoughts that keep you from experiencing peace.

Ray""]",3.64,166,14.0,"The Barnes & Noble ReviewXML has grown into such a diverse set of technologies that it s almost impossible for newcomers to get their hands around it. Fortunately, there s a solution: Erik T. Ray s Learning XML, Second Edition. 

This book presents an outstanding  birds-eye view  of the XML landscape. It s definitely not a programming book (though it does introduce some key XML programming issues). Rather, it s focused on key ideas you need to understand whatever you want to do with XML. That could be document management, web or print content delivery, application integration, B2B commerce, data storage, internationalization -- you name it.

Ray s  day job  is software developer and XML specialist at O Reilly. There, he s helped to implement a complete publishing solution, using DocBook-XML and Perl to produce books in print, on CD-ROM, and for online delivery. So he understands XML from the real-world point of view of someone with a job to do. 

His first goal is to take on the big questions. First, What is XML?  Ray attacks this question from multiple angles, introducing XML as a general-purpose information storage system, a markup language toolkit, and  an open standard (or, increasingly, a collection of standards). What can (and can t) you do with XML? What s the history that led us here? And what tools do you need to get started? 

Next, he introduces the basic building blocks of XML markup and all XML-derived languages: stuff you ll need to know regardless of your goals. Through easy examples, you ll understand elements, attributes, entities, and processing instructions -- and how they fit together in a well-formed XML document. 

Then, it s on to representing information with XML -- in other words, understanding the nature and planning the structure of the documents you ll be using. Ray starts simply, then builds on his basic examples to discuss  narrative  documents with text flows, block and inline elements, and titled sections. Once you can handle those, he discusses more complex information modeling, as used in specialized markup languages such as VML. 

This edition contains an entirely new chapter on XML Schemas -- what he calls the  shepherds  that  keep documents from straying outside of the herd and causing trouble.  Schemas, of course, have become hugely important. This is one of the best plain-English introductions to the topic we ve seen. 

Ray then turns to presentation, introducing CSS stylesheets, basic usage, rule matching, properties, and more. A little later on, he returns to the subject -- this time with a complete introduction to XSL-FO that illuminates two powerful examples. The first is TEI-XML, a markup language for scholarly documents (Ray presents a Shakespearean sonnet, appropriately coded). The second is the immensely powerful DocBook -- which, as we ve observed, Ray knows inside and out. 

Learning XML is superbly written. Clear explanations. Simple examples. Great metaphors and analogies. And excellent introductions to nearly every topic that matters, from links to presentation, transformation to internationalization. If you re just starting out with XML, you re lucky to have it.

Rocky, fragile, beautiful, strange—the Galápagos archipelago is unlike any other place on earth. Its geology, its unique flora and fauna, and its striking role in human history intersect in surprising and dynamic ways. This book is the most wide-ranging and beautifully illustrated book available on the famous islands. Not since Darwin’s Naturalist’s Voyage has a book combined so much scientific and historic information with firsthand accounts that bring the Galápagos to life.
Galá The Islands That Changed the World describes how tragedy and murderous pirates curtailed settlement of the islands and how the islands’ pristine nature, spectacular geology, and defining isolation inspired Darwin’s ideas about evolution. The book explores the diverse land and marine habitats that shelter Galápagos species and considers the islands’ importance today as a frontier for science and a refuge for true wilderness. The book’s extensive gazetteer provides details about endemic plants and animals as well as travel advice about visitors’ sites, diving, photography, when to go, and what to take.

An easily read, entertaining challenge to the whole world of pseudo-science. Unfortunately, the breadth of the topics is probably beyond anyone, and particularly the author, to treat in sufficient detail that convincing cases may be made in most instances. The monumental difficulty throughout history with the occult has been the magnitude of rational effort needed to overcome some simple act of faith, however misguided. Regrettably, many times this book offers cleverjuxtaposition of experiences and rhetoric to beat down claims rather than mounting what facts are known and establishing bounds for hopeful expectations. The body of literature on the topic might have discouraged a less courageous writer and Sladek has worked mightily in producing such a survey of what man has found to believe in, which defies much of practiced science. Seven major sections of the text consider individual topics including UFOs, lost continents, monsters, food cults, numerology, ESP and astrology. The eighth section touches on the bases of these beliefs by considering the place of rumor, prophecy and perceptual psychology as related to the occult. References and bibliography comprise 24 pages.

But amid their buzzing, they are also great communicators—and unusual dancers. As Karl von Frisch (1886–1982) discovered during World War II, bees communicate the location of food sources to each other through complex circle and waggle dances. For centuries, beekeepers had observed these curious movements in hives, and others had speculated about the possibility of a bee language used to manage the work of the hive. But it took von Frisch to determine that the bees’ dances communicated precise information about the distance and direction of food sources. As Tania Munz shows in this exploration of von Frisch’s life and research, this important discovery came amid the tense circumstances of the Third Reich.

The Dancing Bees draws on previously unexplored archival sources in order to reveal von Frisch’s full story, including how the Nazi government in 1940 determined that he was one-quarter Jewish, revoked his teaching privileges, and sought to prevent him from working altogether until circumstances intervened. In the 1940s, bee populations throughout Europe were facing the devastating effects of a plague (just as they are today), and because the bees were essential to the pollination of crops, von Frisch’s research was deemed critical to maintaining the food supply of a nation at war. The bees, as von Frisch put it years later, saved his life. Munz not only explores von Frisch’s complicated career in the Third Reich, she looks closely at the legacy of his work and the later debates about the significance of the bee language and the science of animal communication.

This first in-depth biography of von Frisch paints a complex and nuanced portrait of a scientist at work under Nazi rule. The Dancing Bees will be welcomed by anyone seeking to better understand not only this chapter of the history of science but also the peculiar waggles of our garden visitors.

It is a journey into the Wobbly culture that made Hill and the capitalist culture that killed him. Many aspects of the life and lore of Joe Hill receive their first and only discussion in IWW historian Franklin Rosemont’s opus. In great detail, the issues that Joe Hill raised and grappled with in his life: capitalism, white supremacy, gender, religion, wilderness, law, prison, and industrial unionism are shown in both the context of Hill’s life and for their enduring relevance in the century since his death. Collected too is Joe Hill’s art, plus scores of other images featuring Hill-inspired art by IWW illustrators from Ralph Chaplin to Carlos Cortez, as well as contributions from many other labor artists. As Rosemont suggests in this remarkable book, Joe Hill never really died. He lives in the minds of young (and old) rebels as long as his songs are sung, his ideas are circulated, and his political descendants keep fighting for a better day.","[""History"",""Nonfiction"",""Biography"",""Labor"",""Politics""]",1/1/2003,2003.0,"{""name"":""David R.

In this pioneering book, the renowned German sociologist Wolfgang Sofsky looks at the concentration camp from the inside as a laboratory of cruelty and a system of absolute power built on extreme violence, starvation, ""terror labor,"" and the business-like extermination of human beings.


Based on historical documents and the reports of survivors, the book details how the resistance of prisoners was broken down. Arbitrary terror and routine violence destroyed personal identity and social solidarity, disrupted the very ideas of time and space, perverted human work into torture, and unleashed innumerable atrocities. As a result, daily life was reduced to a permanent struggle for survival, even as the meaning of self-preservation was extinguished. Sofsky takes us from the searing, unforgettable image of the Muselmann--Auschwitz jargon for the ""walking dead""--to chronicles of epidemics, terror punishments, selections, and torture.


The society of the camp was dominated by the S.S. and a system of graduated and forced collaboration which turned selected victims into accomplices of terror. Sofsky shows that the S.S. was not a rigid bureaucracy, but a system with ample room for autonomy. The S.S. demanded individual initiative of its members. Consequently, although they were not required to torment or murder prisoners, officers and guards often exploited their freedom to do so--in passing or on a whim, with cause, or without.


The order of terror described by Sofsky culminated in the organized murder of millions of European Jews and Gypsies in the death-factories of Auschwitz and Treblinka. By the end of this book, Sofsky shows that the German concentration camp system cannot be seen as a temporary lapse into barbarism. Instead, it must be conceived as a product of modern civilization, where institutionalized, state-run human cruelty became possible with or without the mobilizing feelings of hatred.","[""Holocaust"",""History"",""Nonfiction"",""World War II""]",1/1/1993,1993.0,"{""name"":""Wolfgang Sofsky"",""num_books"":31,""num_followers"":""5""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":0,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":3,""reviews_percentage"":3},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":10,""reviews_percentage"":12},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":34,""reviews_percentage"":42},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":33,""reviews_percentage"":41}}","""$39.90""",external,internal_focus,True

The diaries describe appalling conditions in which vermin-infested men were crowded into an open stockade with a single befouled stream as their water source. Food was scarce and medical supplies virtually nonexistent. The bodies of those who did not survive the night had to be cleared away each morning. Designed to house 10,000 Yankee prisoners, Andersonville held 32,000 during August 1864. Nearly a third of the 45,000 prisoners who passed through the camp perished. Exposure, starvation, and disease were the main causes, but excessively harsh penal practices and even violence among themselves contributed to the unprecedented death rate. At the end of the war, outraged Northerners demanded retribution for such travesties, and they received it in the form of the trial and subsequent hanging of Captain Henry Wirz, the prison’s commandant. The trial was the subject of legal controversy for decades afterward, as many people felt justice was ignored in order to appease the Northerners’ moral outrage over the horrors of Andersonville. The story of Andersonville is a complex one involving politics, intrigue, mismanagement, unfortunate timing, and, of course, people - both good and bad.

In her position as America's chief diplomat, Rice traveled almost continuously around the globe, seeking common ground among sometimes bitter enemies, forging agreement on divisive issues, and compiling a remarkable record of achievement.A native of Birmingham, Alabama who overcame the racism of the Civil Rights era to become a brilliant academic and expert on foreign affairs, Rice distinguished herself as an advisor to George W. Bush during the 2000 presidential campaign. Once Bush was elected, she served as his chief adviser on national-security issues—a job whose duties included harmonizing the relationship between the Secretaries of State and Defense. It was a role that deepened her bond with the President and ultimately made her one of his closest confidantes.With the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Rice found herself at the center of the Administration's intense efforts to keep America safe. Here, Rice describes the events of that harrowing day—and the tumultuous days after . No day was ever the same. Additionally, Rice also reveals new details of the debates that led to the war in Afghanistan and then Iraq.The eyes of the nation were once again focused on Rice in 2004 when she appeared before the 9-11 Commission to answer tough questions regarding the country's preparedness for—and immediate response to—the 9-11 attacks. Her responses, it was generally conceded, would shape the nation's perception of the Administration's competence during the crisis. Rice conveys just how pressure-filled that appearance was and her surprised gratitude when, in succeeding days, she was broadly saluted for her performance.From that point forward, Rice was aggressively sought after by the media and regarded by some as the Administration's most effective champion.In 2005 Rice was entrusted with even more responsibility when she was charged with helping to shape and carry forward the President's foreign policy as Secretary of State. As such, she proved herself a deft crafter of tactics and negotiation aimed to contain or reduce the threat posed by America's enemies. Here, she reveals the behind-the-scenes maneuvers that kept the world's relationships with Iran, North Korea and Libya from collapsing into chaos. She also talks about her role as a crisis manager, showing that at any hour—and at a moment's notice—she was willing to bring all parties to the bargaining table anywhere in the world.No Higher Honor takes the reader into secret negotiating rooms where the fates of Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and Lebanon often hung in the balance, and it draws back the curtain on how frighteningly close all-out war loomed in clashes involving Pakistan-India and Russia-Georgia, and in East Africa.  Surprisingly candid in her appraisals of various Administration colleagues and the hundreds of foreign leaders with whom she dealt, Rice also offers here keen insight into how history actually proceeds. In No Higher Honor, she delivers a master class in statecraft—but always in a way that reveals her essential warmth and humility, and her deep reverence for the ideals on which America was founded.","[""Biography"",""Nonfiction"",""Politics"",""Memoir"",""History"",""Autobiography"",""Biography Memoir"",""American History"",""Audiobook"",""Leadership""]",1/1/2011,2011.0,"{""name"":""Condoleezza Rice"",""num_books"":33,""num_followers"":""263""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":95,""reviews_percentage"":2},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":217,""reviews_percentage"":5},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":864,""reviews_percentage"":21},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1445,""reviews_percentage"":36},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1381,""reviews_percentage"":34}}","""$13.99""",external,external_focus,True

These massive offensives were shocking in their scale and intensity, and hugely important. Yet they are largely ignored in the West. Now, with the work of internationally renowned Eastern Front expert Prit Buttar, this story of the unknown side of World War I is finally being told.In Germany Ascendant, Buttar examines the critical year of 1915, when Germany launched the great Gorlice-Tarnow Offensive, lead by Field Marshal Mackensen. The move, which started as a minor German operation to relieve their Austro-Hungarian allies, ultimately resulted in the utter collapse of Russian forces from all of Poland and Gallacia, and came tantalizingly close to knocking Russia out of the war altogether. Next the Germans led the invasion of Serbia, leading Britain and France to intervene with ground troops, an operation that ultimately failed. Yet despite this unbroken string of successes, Germany was still hamstrung by a two-front war. Her every attempt to knock Russia out of the war--military and diplomatic--has failed.

Once known as the greatest deliberative body in the world, it now has a reputation as a partisan, dysfunctional chamber. What happened to the house that forged American history's great compromises? In this groundbreaking work, a distinguished journalist and an eminent historian provide an insider's history of the United States Senate. Richard A. Baker, historian emeritus of the Senate, and Neil MacNeil, former chief congressional correspondent for Time magazine, integrate nearly a century of combined experience on Capitol Hill with deep research and state-of-the-art scholarship. They explore the Senate's historical evolution with one eye on persistent structural pressures and the other on recent transformations. Here, for example, are the Senate's struggles with the presidency--from George Washington's first, disastrous visit to the chamber on August 22, 1789, through now-forgotten conflicts with Presidents Garfield and Cleveland, to current war powers disputes. The authors also explore the Senate's potent investigative power, and show how it began with an inquiry into John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry in 1859. It took flight with committees on the conduct of the Civil War, Reconstruction, and World War II; and it gained a high profile with Joseph McCarthy's rampage against communism, Estes Kefauver's organized-crime hearings (the first to be broadcast), and its Watergate investigation. Within the book are surprises as well. For example, the office of majority leader first acquired real power in 1952--not with Lyndon Johnson, but with Republican Robert Taft. Johnson accelerated the trend, tampering with the sacred principle of seniority in order to control issues such as committee assignments. Rampant filibustering, the authors find, was the ironic result of the passage of 1960s civil rights legislation. No longer stigmatized as a white-supremacist tool, its use became routine, especially as the Senate became more partisan in the 1970s. Thoughtful and incisive, The American Senate: An Insider's History transforms our understanding of Congress's upper house.","[""Politics"",""History"",""Nonfiction"",""American History"",""Government""]",1/1/2013,2013.0,"{""name"":""Neil MacNeil"",""num_books"":16}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":3,""reviews_percentage"":2},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":34,""reviews_percentage"":32},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":46,""reviews_percentage"":43},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":21,""reviews_percentage"":20}}","""$8.95""",external,internal_focus,True

QUILL & QUIRE BEST COVER OF 2016

We think of the modern woman as sexually liberated – if anything, we’re told we’re oversexed. Yet a striking number of women are dissatisfied with their sex lives. Over half of women report having a sexual complaint, whether that’s lack of desire or difficulty reaching orgasm. But this issue doesn’t get much press; the urge is to ignore or medicalize it (witness the quest for ‘pink Viagra’). If so many ordinary women suffer from sexual frustration, then perhaps the problem isn’t one that can be addressed by a pharmaceutical fix – or isn’t a problem. Maybe we need to get hot and bothered about a broader cultural cure: a reorienting of our current male-focused approach to sex and pleasure, and a rethinking of what’s ‘normal.’

Using a blend of reportage, interview and first-person reflection, journalist Sarah Barmak explores the cutting-edge science and grassroots cultural trends that are getting us closer to truth of women’s sexuality. Closer reveals how women are reshaping their sexuality today in wild, irrepressible ways: nude meetings, how-to apps, trans-friendly porn, therapeutic vulva massage, hour-long orgasms and public clit-rubbing demonstrations – and redefining female sexuality on its own terms.

In a provocative challenge to Republican conventional wisdom, two of the Right's rising young thinkers call upon the GOP to focus on the interests and needs of working-class voters.
Grand New Party lays bare the failures of the conservative revolution and presents a detailed blueprint for building the next Republican majority. Blending history, analysis, and fresh, often controversial recommendations, Ross Douthat and Reihan Salam argue that it is time to move beyond the Reagan legacy and the mind-set of the current Republican power structure.
In a concise examination of recent political trends, the authors show that the Democrats' cultural liberalism makes their party inherently hostile to the interests and values of the working class. But on a host of issues, today's Republican Party lacks a message that speaks to their economic aspirations. Grand New Party offers a new direction ""a conservative vision of a limited-but-active government that tackles the threats to working-class prosperity and to the broader American Dream.
With specific proposals covering such hot-button topics as immigration, health care, and taxes, Grand New Party will shake up the Right, challenge the Left, and force both sides to confront and adapt to the changing political landscape.","[""Politics"",""History"",""Nonfiction"",""Economics"",""American History"",""Political Science""]",1/1/2008,2008.0,"{""name"":""Ross Douthat"",""num_books"":16,""num_followers"":""285""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":6,""reviews_percentage"":3},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":16,""reviews_percentage"":9},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":63,""reviews_percentage"":35},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":64,""reviews_percentage"":36},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":28,""reviews_percentage"":15}}","""$14.99""",external,internal_focus,True

Can one find a natural aesthetic that corresponds to a universal order? If so, what importance can it have for the scientist, artist, or layman? What is the ""true"" significance of the triangle, rectangle, spiral, and other geometric shapes? These are but a few of the questions that Professor Matila Ghyka deals with in this fascinating book. The author believes that there are such things as ""The Mathematics of Life"" and ""The Mathematics of Art,"" and that the two coincide. Using simple mathematical formulas, most as basic as Pythagoras' theorem and requiring only a very limited knowledge of mathematics, Professor Ghyka shows the fascinating relationships between geometry, aesthetics, nature, and the human body.Beginning with ideas from Plato, Pythagoras, Archimedes, Ockham, Kepler, and others, the author explores the outlines of an abstract science of space, which includes a theory of proportions, an examination of ""the golden section,"" a study of regular and semi-regular polyhedral, and the interlinking of these various shapes and forms. He then traces the transmission of this spatial science through the Pythagorean tradition and neo-Pythagorism, Greek, and Gothic canons of proportion, the Kabbala, Masonic traditions and symbols, and modern applications in architecture, painting, and decorative art. When we judge a work of art, according to his formulation, we are making it conform to a pattern whose outline is laid down in simple geometrical figures; and it is the analysis of these figures both in art and nature that forms the core of Professor Ghyka's book. He also shows this geometry at work in living organisms. The ample illustrations and figures give concrete examples of the author's analysis: the Great Pyramid and tomb of Rameses IV, the Parthenon, Renaissance paintings and architecture, the work of Seurat, Le Corbusier, and flowers, shells, marine life, the human face, and much more.For the philosopher, scientist, archaeologist, art historian, biologist, poet, and artist as well as the general reader who wants to understand more about the fascinating properties of numbers and geometry, and their relationship to art and life, this is a thought-provoking book.","[""Art"",""Science"",""Mathematics"",""Architecture"",""Philosophy"",""Geometry"",""Nature"",""Nonfiction"",""Design"",""History""]",1/1/1946,1946.0,"{""name"":""Matila Ghyka"",""num_books"":14,""num_followers"":""13""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":3,""reviews_percentage"":2},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":5,""reviews_percentage"":3},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":31,""reviews_percentage"":22},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":40,""reviews_percentage"":28},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":61,""reviews_percentage"":43}}",,external,external_focus,False

On the production line in American packinghouses, there is one cardinal rule: the chain never slows. Every year, the chain conveyors that set the pace of slaughter have continually accelerated to keep up with America's growing appetite for processed meat. Acclaimed journalist Ted Genoways uses the story of Hormel Foods and soaring recession-era demand for its most famous product, Spam, to probe the state of the meatpacking industry, including the expansion of agribusiness and the effects of immigrant labor on Middle America.

Genoways interviewed scores of industry line workers, union leaders, hog farmers, and local politicians and activists. He reveals an industry pushed to its breaking point and exposes alarming new trends: sick or permanently disabled workers, abused animals, water and soil pollution, and mounting conflict between small towns and immigrant workers.

The narrative moves across the heartland, from Minnesota, to witness the cut-and-kill operation; to Iowa, to observe breeding and farrowing in massive hog barns; to Nebraska, to see the tense town hall meetings and broken windows caused by the arrival of Hispanic workers; and back to Minnesota, where political refugees from Burma give the workforce the power it needs to fight back.

A work of brilliant reporting, The Chain is a mesmerizing story and an urgent warning about the hidden cost of the food we eat.","[""Nonfiction"",""Food"",""Science"",""Animals"",""Business"",""History"",""Agriculture"",""Social Justice"",""Labor"",""Nature""]",10/14/2014,2014.0,"{""name"":""Ted Genoways"",""num_books"":37,""num_followers"":""17""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":4,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":25,""reviews_percentage"":5},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":114,""reviews_percentage"":24},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":206,""reviews_percentage"":44},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":110,""reviews_percentage"":23}}","""$7.12""",external,external_focus,True

The name is infamous, and yet the place, and its inhabitants, have been nearly impenetrable. Until now.Humboldt is a narrative exploration of an insular community in Northern California, which for nearly 40 years has existed primarily on the cultivation and sale of marijuana. It's a place where business is done with thick wads of cash and savings are buried in the backyard. In Humboldt County, marijuana supports everything from fire departments to schools, but it comes with a heavy price. As legalization looms, the community stands at a crossroads and its inhabitants are deeply divided on the issue--some want to claim their rightful heritage as master growers and have their livelihood legitimized, others want to continue reaping the inflated profits of the black market.

Long after the rest of Europe and neighboring Scotland had reformed their marriage laws, England clung to the chaotic and contradictory laws of the medieval Church, making it all too easy to enter into a marriage but virtually impossible to end an unhappy one. If England was a ""paradise for wives"" it could only have been through the feistiness of the women. Married women were placed in the same legal category as lunatics. While Englishmen prided themselves on their devotion to liberty, their wives were no freer than slaves. It was a husband’s jealously guarded right to beat his wife, as long as the stick was no bigger than his thumb. With a cast of hundreds, from loyal and devoted wives in troubled times to those who featured in notorious trials for adultery, from abusive husbands whose excesses were only gradually curbed by the law to the modern phenomenon of the toxic wife, acclaimed historian Maureen Waller draws on intimate letters, diaries, court documents, and advice books to trace the evolution of the English marriage.

""I have reached an age when, if someone tells me to wear socks, I don't have to.""-- Albert Einstein


Albert Einstein was a prolific--and often thoughtful and gifted--writer, and he is immensely quotable. This collection of approximately 550 quotations by and about Einstein for the first time arranges his thoughts and ideas thematically. Here we can easily find Einstein's thoughts on everything from America and Americans, Germans and Germany, Jews and Zionism, war and peace, politics, religion and science, to more personal subjects, such as abortion, youth and aging, love and marriage, music, and pets. There is something to please everyone--and something to offend everyone. Also included are sections on what Einstein has said about other famous people, what others have said about him, a chronology including biographical data, an updated family tree that includes great-great-grandchildren, answers to the most common questions about Einstein, and a selected bibliography. The book includes an engaging foreword by Princeton physicist Freeman Dyson.


To help the reader or researcher, two indexes are provided. The Index of Key Words will help readers find familiar quotations, and the Subject Index will lead them to subjects of particular interest. The book provides documentation, generally of primary sources such as the Einstein Archive and The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein.


This book introduces readers to Einstein's many  by turns irascible and benign, warmly humorous and coldly dismissive, one who was at first bemused by the fame the world bestowed on him but who came to abhor the glare of publicity. We also see Einstein's development from the earliest quotations of a seventeen-year-old boy to his final words at age seventy-six.","[""Nonfiction"",""Science"",""Biography"",""Reference"",""Philosophy"",""Physics"",""History"",""Unfinished""]",9/1/1996,1996.0,"{""name"":""Albert Einstein"",""num_books"":862,""num_followers"":""9372""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":6,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":16,""reviews_percentage"":4},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":83,""reviews_percentage"":22},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":120,""reviews_percentage"":33},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":138,""reviews_percentage"":38}}","""$0.99""",external,external_focus,False

Paul Getty created the greatest fortune in America - and came close to destroying his own family in the process. Of his four sons who reached manhood, only one survived relatively unscathed. One killed himself, one became a drug-addicted recluse and the third had to bear the stigma all his life of being disinherited in childhood.The unhappiness continued into the next generation, with the name Getty, as one journalist put it, 'becoming synonymous for family dysfunction'. Getty's once favourite grandson John Paul Getty III was kidnapped by the Italian mafia who cut off his ear to raise a ransom and, after a lifetime of drink and drugs, became a paraplegic. His granddaughter Aileen has AIDS. And the Getty family itself has been torn apart by litigation over their poisoned inheritance.But did the disaster have to happen? John Pearson, who has specialized in biographies of families as varied as the Churchills, the British Royal Family, the Devonshires and the Krays, sets out to find the answer. The result, first published in 1995, is a fascinating saga of an extraordinary dynasty.He traces much of the trouble to the bizarre character of the avaricious, sex-obsessed billionaire, J. Paul Getty himself - and demonstrates how much of his behaviour has been repeated in succeeding generations. He describes the famous kidnapping of his grandson in graphic detail, revealing how the old man's attitude added considerably to the boy's sufferings. And he shows how the family has coped with the latest modern  drugs and AIDS.For All the Money in the World is not a hopeless story. While some of the family have been damaged by the Getty legacy, others have saved themselves from disaster, most notably the cricket-loving philanthropist, J. Paul Getty Jr. Pearson's moving story of his recovery from drugs and deep personal tragedy shows that there is hope for future generations of this stricken family - and demonstrates that money can be used to buy survival and even happiness.","[""Nonfiction"",""Biography"",""History"",""True Crime"",""Media Tie In"",""Biography Memoir"",""American History"",""Americana"",""Collections"",""Film""]",1/1/1995,1995.0,"{""name"":""John George Pearson"",""num_books"":33,""num_followers"":""21""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":32,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":146,""reviews_percentage"":9},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":508,""reviews_percentage"":31},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":633,""reviews_percentage"":39},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":290,""reviews_percentage"":18}}","""$6.28""",external,external_focus,True

Objective: The difference between believing and disbelieving a proposition is one of the most potent regulators of human behavior and emotion. When we accept a statement as true, it becomes the basis for further thought and action; rejected as false, it remains a string of words. The purpose of this study was to differentiate belief, disbelief, and uncertainty at the level of the brain.

Methods: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the brains of 14 adults while they judged written statements to be “true” (belief), “false” (disbelief), or “undecidable” (uncertainty). To characterize belief, disbelief, and uncertainty in a content-independent manner, we included statements from a wide range of categories: autobiographical, mathematical, geographical, religious, ethical, semantic, and factual.

Results: The states of belief, disbelief, and uncertainty differentially activated distinct regions of the prefrontal and parietal cortices, as well as the basal ganglia.

Interpretation: Belief and disbelief differ from uncertainty in that both provide information that can subsequently inform behavior and emotion. The mechanism underlying this difference appears to involve the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the caudate. While many areas of higher cognition are likely involved in assessing the truth-value of linguistic propositions, the final acceptance of a statement as “true,” or its rejection as “false,” seems to rely on more primitive, hedonic processing in the medial prefrontal cortex and the anterior insula. Truth may be beauty, and beauty truth, in more than a metaphorical sense, and false propositions might actually disgust us.

“Failure is all around us,” asserts Ormerod. For every General Electric–still going strong after more than one hundred years–there are dozens of businesses like Central Leather, which was one of the world’s largest companies in 1912 but was liquidated in 1952. Ormerod debunks conventional economic theory–that the world economy ticks along in perfect equilibrium according to the best-laid plans of business and government–and delves into the reasons for the failure of brands, entire companies, and public policies. Inspired by recent advances in evolutionary theory and biology, Ormerod illuminates the ways in which companies and policy-setting sectors of government behave much like living  unless they evolve, they die. But he also makes clear how desirable social and economic outcomes may be achieved when individuals, companies and governments adapt in response to the actual behavior and requirements of their customers and constituents.

At the heart of this groundbreaking book are two urgent questions: What do our young children need in the earliest years of school, and how do we ensure that they all get it? Cutting-edge research has proven that early childhood education is crucial for all children to gain the academic and emotional skills they need to succeed later in life. Children who attend quality pre-K programs have a host of positive outcomes including better language, literacy, problem-solving and math skills down the line, and they have a leg up on what appears to be the most essential skill to develop at age four: strong self-control. But even with this overwhelming evidence, early childhood education is at a crossroads in America. We know that children can and do benefit, but we also know that too many of our littlest learners don't get that chance--millions of parents can't find spots for their children, or their preschoolers end up in poor quality programs.

With engrossing storytelling, journalist Suzanne Bouffard takes us inside some of the country's best pre-K classrooms to reveal the sometimes surprising ingredients that make them work--and to understand why some programs are doing the opposite of what is best for children. It also chronicles the stories of families and teachers from many backgrounds as they struggle to give their children a good start in school. This book is a call to arms when we are at a crucial moment, and perhaps on the verge of a missed opportunity: We now have the means and the will to have universal pre-kindergarten, but we are also in grave danger of not getting it right.","[""Parenting"",""Nonfiction"",""Education"",""Teaching"",""Audiobook"",""Childrens"",""Unfinished""]",9/5/2017,2017.0,"{""name"":""Suzanne Bouffard"",""num_books"":3,""num_followers"":""7""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":2,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":12,""reviews_percentage"":3},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":69,""reviews_percentage"":19},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":161,""reviews_percentage"":45},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":108,""reviews_percentage"":30}}","""$14.99""",external,external_focus,True

Now, for the first time in one volume, Wallerstein offers a succinct summary of world-systems analysis and a clear outline of the modern world-system, describing the structures of knowledge upon which it is based, its mechanisms, and its future. Wallerstein explains the defining characteristics of world-systems analysis: its emphasis on world-systems rather than nation-states, on the need to consider historical processes as they unfold over long periods of time, and on combining within a single analytical framework bodies of knowledge usually viewed as distinct from one another—such as history, political science, economics, and sociology. He describes the world-system as a social reality comprised of interconnected nations, firms, households, classes, and identity groups of all kinds. He identifies and highlights the significance of the key moments in the evolution of the modern world-system: the development of a capitalist world-economy in the sixteenth-century, the beginning of two centuries of liberal centrism in the French Revolution of 1789, and the undermining of that centrism in the global revolts of 1968.

He is one of the world's most fascinating and least understood figures: now sixty-six, Prince Charles has spent his entire life preparing to be king while insisting on being his own man. In this brilliant portrait, he emerges as a complex character driven by a painful past, a questing intellect, and a powerful impulse not only to reshape the monarchy but to use the long wait for the throne to work toward high ideals.

Based on exclusive interviews with members of Charles's inner circle and on rare access to the Prince himself, this revelatory biography takes us deep into the royal sphere—a world of its own that Catherine Mayer calls Planet Windsor—and shows us the skullduggery and unintentional comedy of court life. At the same time, it provides a clear-eyed view of Charles's struggles and his achievements as a philanthropist and activist. The book also offers a fundamental reappraisal of one of the most documented episodes in modern history—his marriage to Diana. The reality, as with many aspects of the Prince's story, is more gripping and more poignant than we knew.Now closer than ever to achieving happiness, the Prince is still far from settled. He remains committed to bringing about social and political change, but in aiming to be a king of hearts, he often creates heartache, for himself and others.

― The Economist This is the companion volume to Brain of the Firm and addresses the nature of viable systems, those capable of surviving. It does not use the neurophysiological basis elucidated in brain, but develops the same theory from first principles. This book declares that every enterprise is a system, and in particular must be a viable system. Viability is not just a matter of economic solvency; we need laws that govern the capacity of any enterprise to maintain independent existence. The Heart of Enterprise is full of examples (actual, author-generated examples) taken from management practice. ""I consistently find that Stafford Beer provides the most useful analytical framework for understanding and managing an enterprise--public or private. Heart of The Enterprise offers a demanding but rewarding exposition of his approach and applications.""

It is, hands down, the best description of the transformation of untested young men into soldiers that I have ever read.” — Lynne Olson, New York Times Bestselling Author of Last Hope Island   The untold story of five young American friends who left the ivory towers at Harvard and Dartmouth to take on Rommel's Panzers under the blazing sun of North Africa.   In the spring of 1941, with Europe consumed by war and occupation, Britain stood alone against the Nazi menace. The United States remained wary of joining the costly and destructive conflict. But for five extraordinary young Americans, the global threat of fascism was too great to ignore.   Six months before Pearl Harbor, these courageous idealists left their promising futures behind to join the beleaguered British Army. Fighting as foreigners, they were shipped off to join the Desert Rats, the 7th Armoured Division of the British Eighth Army, who were battling Field Marshal Rommel’s panzer division. The Yanks would lead antitank and machine-gun platoons into combat at the Second Battle of El Alamein, the twelve-day epic of tank warfare that would ultimately turn the tide for the Allies.   A fitting tribute to five men whose commitment to freedom transcended national boundaries, Into Dust and Fire is a gripping true tale of idealism, courage, camaraderie, sacrifice, and heroism.

Its success ""might have established communal property, a far wider democracy in political and legal institutions, might have disestablished the state church and rejected the protestant ethic."" 

In The World Turned Upside Down, Christopher Hill studies the beliefs of such radical groups as the Diggers, the Ranters, the Levellers and others, and the social and emotional impulses that gave rise to them. 

The relations between rich and poor classes, the part played by wandering 'masterless men,' the outbursts of sexual freedom and deliberate blasphemy, the great imaginative creations of Milton and Bunyan - these and many other elements build up into a marvellously detailed and coherent portrait of this strange, sudden effusion of revolutionary beliefs. It is a portrait not of the bourgeois revolution that actually took place, but of the impulse towards a far more fundamental overturning of society.

Thorough in its coverage of basic theory, from the lever and inclined plane to internal combustion engines and power trains, it requires nothing more than an understanding of the most elementary mathematics.
Beginning with the simplest of machines — the lever — the text proceeds to discussions of the block and tackle (pulleys and hoists), wheel and axle, the inclined plane and the wedge, the screw, and different types of gears (simple, spur, bevel, herringbone, spiral, worm, etc.). A chapter on the concept of work discusses the measurement of work, friction, and efficiency; this is followed by investigations of power, force, and pressure, with explanations of the uses of scales, balances, gauges, and barometers. The fundamentals of hydrostatic and hydraulic machines (such as the hydraulic braking system and the hydraulic press) are discussed in detail.
The remaining chapters cover machine elements (bearings and springs), basic mechanisms (gear differential, couplings, cams, clutches), the internal combustion engine and power trains (including explanations of various transmission systems — synchromesh, auxiliary, etc.).
Every concept is clearly defined, and discussions always build easily from elementary theory to specific applications familiar to anyone with the slightest interest in mechanics. Important concepts, machine components, and techniques are clearly illustrated in more than 200 diagrams, drawings, and cross-sections that reveal inner workings — all of these help to clarify even further an already clear and well-organized presentation.

Mill, and Nancy Holmstrom discuss alleged differences between women and men, and a paper by Henry Bracken deals with racial issues. Examples from E.O. Wilson's sociobiology and his critics are also included, together with material from Chomsky and from recent evolutionary psychology.
This new edition includes more substantial selections from the Hindu, Confucian, and Christian traditions and provides more accessible extracts from Marx, Sartre, and Lorenz.

The count’s eldest daughter, Matilda, had refused William’s offer of marriage and publicly denounced him as a bastard. Encountering the young woman, William furiously dragged her to the ground by her hair and beat her mercilessly. Matilda’s outraged father immediately took up arms on his daughter’s behalf. But just a few days later, Baldwin was aghast when Matilda, still recovering from the assault, announced that she would marry none but William, since “he must be a man of great courage and high daring” to have ventured to “come and beat me in my own father’s palace.”   Thus began the tempestuous marriage of Matilda of Flanders and William the Conqueror. While William’s exploits and triumphs have been widely chronicled, his consort remains largely overlooked. Now, in her groundbreaking Queen of the Conqueror, acclaimed author and historian Tracy Borman weaves together a comprehensive and illuminating tapestry of this noble woman who stood only four-foot-two and whose role as the first crowned Queen of England had a large and lasting influence on the English monarchy.   From a wealth of historical artifacts and documents, Matilda emerges as passionate, steadfast, and wise, yet also utterly ruthless and tenacious in pursuit of her goals, and the only person capable of taming her formidable husband—who, unprecedented for the period, remained staunchly faithful to her. This mother of nine, including four sons who went on to inherit William’s French and English dominions, confounded the traditional views of women in medieval society by seizing the reins of power whenever she had the chance, directing her husband’s policy, and at times flagrantly disobeying his orders.   Tracy Borman lays out Matilda’s remarkable story against one of the most fascinating and transformative periods in European history. Stirring, richly detailed, and wholly involving, Queen of the Conqueror reveals not just an extraordinary figure but an iconic woman who shaped generations, and an era that cast the essential framework for the world we know today.","[""History"",""Biography"",""Nonfiction"",""Historical"",""Medieval"",""British Literature"",""Medieval History"",""France"",""11th Century"",""Biography Memoir""]",9/1/2011,2011.0,"{""name"":""Tracy Borman"",""num_books"":23,""num_followers"":""667""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":25,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":90,""reviews_percentage"":5},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":394,""reviews_percentage"":24},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":603,""reviews_percentage"":38},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":473,""reviews_percentage"":29}}","""$10.99""",external,external_focus,True

He visited dozens of these communities — virtually every one in existence — and read extensively in their doctrinal and other literature in preparation for this book. His straightforward, factual report on what he saw and learned is still a vital document for students of American history, sociology, and culture.
The Amana Society, the Harmonists at Economy, the Separatists of Zoar, the Shakers, the Oneida and Wallingford Perfectionists, the Aurora and Bethel communes, the Icarians, the Bishop Hill colony, the Cedar Vale commune, the Social Freedom Community, and three non-communistic colonies (Anaheim, California; Vineland, New Jersey; and Silkville Prairie Home, Kansas) are all examined in detail. They emerge from these pages as living experiments in human relations.
For each community, Nordhoff discusses history, religious or other guiding philosophy, social habits, and customs, and business and administration. He also supplies vignettes of his visits and interviews, vividly describing the houses and other buildings, the physical settings, the clothing, food, everyday conversation, intellectual and aesthetic aspiration, etc. within each society.
With its concluding chapter on conditions requisite to the success of a communistic society and on the effects of such a society upon its members, and its 38 illustrations of interiors and exteriors, typical clothing styles, and so on, Nordhoff's work is a refreshingly unprejudiced report on socialism and communism in their prescientific infancy.

To really understand Einstein's theory of relativity – one of the cornerstones of modern physics – you have to get to grips with the underlying mathematics. A Most Incomprehensible Thing is aimed at the general reader who is motivated to tackle that not insignificant challenge. With a user-friendly style, clear step-by-step mathematical derivations, many fully solved problems and numerous diagrams, this self-study guide provides an accessible introduction to a fascinating but complex subject.

For those with minimal mathematical background, the first chapter gives a crash course in foundation mathematics. The reader is then taken gently by the hand and guided through a wide range of fundamental topics , including Newtonian mechanics; the Lorentz transformations; the all important metric tensor g μν ; tensor calculus; the Einstein field equations; the Schwarzschild solution (which gives a good approximation of the spacetime of our Solar System); black holes, relativistic cosmology and gravitational waves.
“I must observe that the theory of relativity resembles a building consisting of two separate stories, the special theory and the general theory. The special theory, on which the general theory rests, applies to all physical phenomena with the exception of gravitation; the general theory provides the law of gravitation and its relations to the other forces of nature.” – Albert Einstein , 1919

Understand even the basics of Einstein's amazing theory and the world will never seem the same again.

https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/164673.Recovered_Roots,164673.Recovered_Roots,Recovered Roots: Collective Memory and the Making of Israeli National Tradition,"[""Yael Zerubavel""]",3.74,58,7.0,"Because new nations need new pasts, they create new ways of commemorating and recasting select historic events. In Recovered Roots , Yael Zerubavel illuminates this dynamic process by examining the construction of Israeli national tradition.

In the years leading to the birth of Israel, Zerubavel shows, Zionist settlers in Palestine consciously sought to rewrite Jewish history by reshaping Jewish memory. Zerubavel focuses on the nationalist reinterpretation of the defense of Masada against the Romans in 73 C.E. and the Bar Kokhba revolt of 133-135; and on the transformation of the 1920 defense of a new Jewish settlement in Tel Hai into a national myth. Zerubavel demonstrates how, in each case, Israeli memory transforms events that ended in death and defeat into heroic myths and symbols of national revival.

Drawing on a broad range of official and popular sources and original interviews, Zerubavel shows that the construction of a new national tradition is not necessarily the product of government policy but a creative collaboration between politicans, writers, and educators. Her discussion of the politics of commemoration demonstrates how rival groups can turn the past into an arena of conflict as they posit competing interpretations of history and opposing moral claims on the use of the past. Zerubavel analyzes the emergence of counter-memories within the reality of Israel's frequent wars, the ensuing debates about the future of the occupied territories, and the embattled relations with Palestinians.

A fascinating examination of the interplay between history and memory, this book will appeal to historians, sociologists, anthropologists, political scientists, and folklorists, as well as to scholars of cultural studies, literature, and communication.","[""Nonfiction"",""History"",""Israel"",""Academic"",""Religion""]",10/15/1995,1995.0,"{""name"":""Yael Zerubavel"",""num_books"":6}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":2,""reviews_percentage"":3},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":21,""reviews_percentage"":36},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":21,""reviews_percentage"":36},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":13,""reviews_percentage"":22}}",,external,external_focus,True

After the fall of the Manchu dynasty in 1912, Xianyu's father gave his daughter to a Japanese friend who was sympathetic to his efforts to reclaim power. This man raised Xianyu, now known as Kawashima Yoshiko, to restore the Manchus to their former glory. Her fearsome dedication to this cause ultimately got her killed.

Yoshiko had a fiery personality and loved the limelight. She shocked Japanese society by dressing in men's clothes and rose to prominence as Commander Jin, touted in Japan's media as a new Joan of Arc. Boasting a short, handsome haircut and a genuine military uniform, Commander Jin was credited with various daring exploits, among them riding horseback as leader of her own army during the Japanese occupation of China. 

While trying to promote the Manchus, Yoshiko supported the puppet Manchu state established by the Japanese in 1932, which became one of the reasons she was executed for treason after Japan's 1945 defeat. The truth of Yoshiko's life is still a source of contention between China and Japan -- some believe she was exploited by powerful men, others claim she relished her role as political provocateur. China holds her responsible for unspeakable crimes, while Japan has forgiven her transgressions. This biography presents the most accurate and colorful portrait to date of the controversial princess spy, recognizing her truly novel role in conflicts that transformed East Asia.","[""History"",""Nonfiction"",""Japan"",""Biography"",""Asia"",""China"",""Biography Memoir"",""Espionage"",""Historical"",""Japanese History""]",4/14/2015,2015.0,"{""name"":""Phyllis Birnbaum"",""num_books"":19,""num_followers"":""12""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":6,""reviews_percentage"":4},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":24,""reviews_percentage"":18},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":50,""reviews_percentage"":37},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":36,""reviews_percentage"":27},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":17,""reviews_percentage"":12}}","""$14.74""",external,external_focus,True

A century ago, in the era of Jim Crow, Booker T. Washington pursued a different strategy to lift his people. In this compelling biography, Norrell reveals how conditions in the segregated South led Washington to call for a less contentious path to freedom and equality. He urged black people to acquire economic independence and to develop the moral character that would ultimately gain them full citizenship. Although widely accepted as the most realistic way to integrate blacks into American life during his time, Washington’s strategy has been disparaged since the 1960s. The first full-length biography of Booker T. in a generation, Up from History recreates the broad contexts in which Washington worked: He struggled against white bigots who hated his economic ambitions for blacks, African-American intellectuals like W. E. B. Du Bois who resented his huge influence, and such inconstant allies as Theodore Roosevelt. Norrell details the positive power of Washington’s vision, one that invoked hope and optimism to overcome past exploitation and present discrimination. Indeed, his ideas have since inspired peoples across the Third World that there are many ways to struggle for equality and justice. Up from History reinstates this extraordinary historical figure to the pantheon of black leaders, illuminating not only his mission and achievement but also, poignantly, the man himself.","[""History"",""Biography"",""Race"",""Nonfiction"",""American History"",""Education"",""African American""]",1/15/2009,2009.0,"{""name"":""Robert J.

Time and again, moments shape history. We often examine history from a distant vantage, zooming in on a few kings and battles. But history is made up of individuals who were as alive in their time as we are today. Pausing on a few key individuals and magnifying specific moments in their lives allows us to experience history in a whole new way-as a vibrant story, full of life.

Living History: Great Events of the Ancient and Medieval Worlds takes you back in time and throws a spotlight on two dozen turning points where the tide of history changes irrevocably. These 24 dramatic lectures examine key events from ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome to medieval Europe and Asia. Spanning thousands of years and three continents, this course illuminates fascinating historical dramas on the individual scale.

More than covering great events that change the contours of history, Professor Garland takes you into the scene and allows you to hear what he terms the ""heartbeat of history"". Rather than merely reviewing the facts of events such as the Battle of Marathon, the arrest and trial of Jesus, and the coronation of Charlemagne, you'll engage with a variety of firsthand accounts and authentic primary and secondary sources to experience what it was like to live these events as they occurred. From reports by historians such as Herodotus and Livy to official scrolls and administrative records, these eyewitness sources and ancient documents take you back in time through the eyes of people who were there.

But how democratic is our own ""democracy""? If you can vote, if the majority rules, if you have elected representatives--does this automatically mean that you have a democracy? In this eye-opening look at an ideal that we all take for granted, classical scholar Paul Woodruff offers some surprising answers to these questions.
Drawing on classical literature, philosophy, and history--with many intriguing passages from Sophocles, Aesop, and Plato, among others--Woodruff immerses us in the world of ancient Athens to uncover how the democratic impulse first came to life. The heart of the book isolates seven conditions that are the sine qua non of  freedom from tyranny , harmony, the rule of law, natural equality, citizen wisdom, reasoning without knowledge, and general education. He concludes that a true democracy must be willing to invite everyone to join in government. It must respect the rule of law so strongly that even the government is not above the law. True democracy must be mature enough to accept changes that come from the people. And it must be willing to pay the price of education for thoughtful citizenship. If we learn anything from the story of Athens, Woodruff concludes, it should be this--never lose sight of the ideals of democracy. This compact, eloquent book illuminates
these ideals and lights the way as we struggle to keep democracy alive at home and around the world.","[""History"",""Philosophy"",""Politics"",""Nonfiction""]",1/1/2005,2005.0,"{""name"":""Paul Woodruff"",""num_books"":47,""num_followers"":""23""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":0,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":19,""reviews_percentage"":10},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":52,""reviews_percentage"":27},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":73,""reviews_percentage"":39},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":42,""reviews_percentage"":22}}",,external,internal_focus,True

The author shows how we are told only half the story of the original contract that establishes modern patriarchy. The sexual contract is ignored and thus men's patriarchal right over women is also glossed over. No attention is paid to the problems that arise when women are excluded from the original contract but incorporated into the new contractual order.

One of the main targets of the book is those who try to turn contractarian theory to progressive use, and a major thesis of the book is that this is not possible. Thus those feminists who have looked to a more ""proper"" contract- one between genuinely equal partners, or one entered into without any coercion- are misleading themselves. In the author's words, ""In contract theory universal freedom is always a hypothesis, a story, a political fiction. Contract always generates political right in the forms of domination and subordination."" Thus the book is also aimed at mainstream political theorists, and socialist and other critics of contract theory.

The author offers a sweeping challenge to conventional understandings- of both left and right- of actual contracts in everyday  the marriage contract, the employment contract, the prostitution contract, and the new surrogate mother contract. By bringing a feminist perspective to bear on the contradictions and paradoxes surrounding women and contract, and the relation between the sexes, she is able to shed new light on fundamental political problems of freedom and subordination.","[""Feminism"",""Philosophy"",""Nonfiction"",""Politics"",""Gender"",""Theory"",""Sociology"",""Womens"",""Political Science"",""History""]",1/1/1988,1988.0,"{""name"":""Carole Pateman"",""num_books"":24,""num_followers"":""24""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":9,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":23,""reviews_percentage"":4},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":108,""reviews_percentage"":22},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":183,""reviews_percentage"":38},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":153,""reviews_percentage"":32}}","""$23.00""",external,external_focus,True

To create Drunk Stoned Brilliant Dead, former Lampoon illustrator Rick Meyerowitz selected the funniest material from the magazine and sought out the survivors of its first electrifying decade to gather their most revealing and outrageous stories. The result is a mind-boggling tour through the early days of an institution whose alumni left their fingerprints all over popular  Animal House , Caddyshack , Saturday Night Live , Ghostbusters , SCTV , Spinal Tap , In Living Color , Ren & Stimpy , The Simpsons —even Sesame Street counts a few Lampooners among its ranks. Long before there was The Onion and Comedy Central news shows, there was the National Lampoon, setting the bar in comedy impossibly high!

A very similar title, differing only in the subtitle, was used for the 2015 documentary film, Drunk Stoned Brilliant  The Story of the National Lampoon , for which Rick Meyerowitz designed the poster, as he also did for the 1978 film National Lampoon's Animal House .

Praise for the documentary Drunk Stoned Brilliant Dead (2015):

In fact, as world-renowned animal behaviorist Thomas Seeley reveals, these incredible insects have much to teach us when it comes to collective wisdom and effective decision making. A remarkable and richly illustrated account of scientific discovery, Honeybee Democracy brings together, for the first time, decades of Seeley's pioneering research to tell the amazing story of house hunting and democratic debate among the honeybees.

In the late spring and early summer, as a bee colony becomes overcrowded, a third of the hive stays behind and rears a new queen, while a swarm of thousands departs with the old queen to produce a daughter colony. Seeley describes how these bees evaluate potential nest sites, advertise their discoveries to one another, engage in open deliberation, choose a final site, and navigate together--as a swirling cloud of bees--to their new home. Seeley investigates how evolution has honed the decision-making methods of honeybees over millions of years, and he considers similarities between the ways that bee swarms and primate brains process information. He concludes that what works well for bees can also work well for people: any decision-making group should consist of individuals with shared interests and mutual respect, a leader's influence should be minimized, debate should be relied upon, diverse solutions should be sought, and the majority should be counted on for a dependable resolution.

An impressive exploration of animal behavior, Honeybee Democracy shows that decision-making groups, whether honeybee or human, can be smarter than even the smartest individuals in them.","[""Nonfiction"",""Science"",""Nature"",""Animals"",""Biology"",""Politics"",""Environment"",""History"",""Gardening"",""Ecology""]",10/10/2010,2010.0,"{""name"":""Thomas D.

По накатанной колее
Мы слишком много делаем вещей, причины возникновения которых не понимаем. Мы живем по накатанной колее и скатываемся в болото, которое, как нам кажется, с нами точно не приключится.

Разрушитель времени
Телефон — везде с нами. Мы вынуждены быть на связи и отвечать на сообщения почти мгновенно. Так принято, разве нет? Это разрушает наше время, наши планы и делает совершенно невозможным какой-либо тайм-менеджмент.

Еда как враг
Я человек, которого бросает в пот при виде двухлетнего ребенка, сосущего колу. Мне больно видеть половину детей из первого класса, уже имеющих лишний вес. Мне стыдно за соплеменников на пляжах мира, которые по умолчанию поставляются туда с надутыми животами.

Churchill: The Prophet of Truth, 1922–1939 (Volume V)","[""Martin  Gilbert""]",4.36,152,9.0,"This fascinating volume, based upon a wealth of private archives, charts Churchill's career between the wars. It opens with his return to Conservatism and to the Cabinet in 1924, and, as the story unfolds, presents a vivid and intimate picture of Churchill's public life and of his private world at Chartwell.

Martin Gilbert shows how, as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1924 to 1929, Churchill pursued with vigor a humane and constructive social policy, including the introduction of pensions for widows and orphans. Britain's controversial return to the Gold Standard is examined here on the basis of new evidence; so too are Churchill's strenuous and forward-looking efforts after the General Strike to bring peace to the coal industry. Never afraid of political hostility from his Conservative colleagues, Churchill sought a policy of fair-dealing and active Government conciliation in industrial relations. In 1927 he planned, and then fought in the Cabinet for a massive attack on unemployment by means of a complete change in the tax system. He was helped in his task by a young Tory member of Parliament, Harold MacMillan, in whom he confided.

In this volume, Martin Gilbert strips away four decades of accumulated myth and innuendo, showing Churchill's real stand on India, his precise role during the Abdication of Edward VIII (and his private thoughts on Mrs. Simpson), his true attitude to Mussolini, and his profound fears for the future of European democracy. Even before Hitler came to power in Germany, Churchill saw in full the dangers of a Nazi victory. Despite the unpopularity of his views in official circles, for six years he persevered in his warnings. This volume shows just how courageous and accurate those warnings were, how several members of the Cabinet -- including Anthony Eden -- shared their worries with him, and yet how bitter and irreconcilable was the opposition he encountered, first from Baldwin, then from Neville Chamberlain.

This book tells for the first time the extent to which senior civil servants, and even military officers of high rank, came to Churchill with secret information, having despaired at the extent of official lethargy and obstruction. Within the Air Ministry, the Foreign Office, and the Intelligence Services, individuals felt drawn to go to Churchill with full disclosures of Britain's defense weakness, and kept him informed of day-to-day developments from 1934 until the outbreak of the war. A wealth of new and fascinating evidence illuminates this secret aspect of Churchill's career. In presenting so many unknown facets of Churchill's public and private life, Martin Gilbert shows how, as war approached, people of all parties and in all walks of life recognized Churchill's unique qualities, demanded his immediate inclusion in the Government, and believed that he alone could give a divided nation guidance and inspiration.","[""Biography"",""History"",""Nonfiction"",""Biography Memoir"",""Politics"",""World War II"",""Reference""]",1/1/1976,1976.0,"{""name"":""Martin  Gilbert"",""num_books"":206,""num_followers"":""383""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":6,""reviews_percentage"":3},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1,""reviews_percentage"":0},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":15,""reviews_percentage"":9},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":41,""reviews_percentage"":26},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":89,""reviews_percentage"":58}}","""$11.99""",external,external_focus,True

How were these decisions made? What were the options facing these leaders as they saw them? What intelligence, right and wrong, did they have? What was the impact of personality, what that of larger forces? In a brilliant work with haunting contemporary relevance, Ian Kershaw tells the connected stories of these ten fateful decisions from the shifting perspectives of the protagonists, and in so doing rescues them from the sense of inevitability that now envelops them and restores to them a feeling of vivid drama and contingency-the feeling that things could have turned out very differently indeed. Each chapter follows the process of arriving at one decision, from the viewpoint of the leader who made it:  Decision 1: May 1940. The British War Cabinet, driven by Churchill, agrees to fight on after the German blitzkrieg defeat of France, despite loud calls for negotiated settlement. Decision 2: Hitler decides to attack the Soviet Union. Decision 3: Japan decides to seize the ""Golden Opportunity"" and turn south, going after the colonial empires of the countries that have fallen to Hitler. Decision 4: Mussolini decides to join the war on Hitler's side to grab a share of the spoils. Decision 5: Roosevelt decides to lend a helping hand to England. Decision 6: Stalin decides he knows best and ignores all the clear signals that Germany is going to invade. Decision 7: Roosevelt decides to wage undeclared war. Decision 8: Japan decides to go to war against the United States. Decision 9: Hitler decides to declare war on the USA. Decision 10: Hitler decides to kill the Jews.

The majority of these people were black; nearly all were poor. The Federal government's slow response to local appeals for help is by now notorious. Yet despite the cries of outrage that have mounted since the levees broke, we have failed to confront the disaster's true lesson: to be poor, or black, in today's ownership society, is to be left behind. Displaying the intellectual rigor, political passion, and personal empathy that have won him acclaim and fans all across the color line, Michael Eric Dyson offers a searing assessment of the meaning of Hurricane Katrina. Combining interviews with survivors of the disaster with his deep knowledge of black migrations and government policy over decades, Dyson provides the historical context that has been sorely missing from public conversation. He explores the legacy of black suffering in America since slavery and ties its psychic scars to today's crisis. And, finally, his critique of the way black people are framed in the national consciousness will shock and surprise even the most politically savvy reader. With this clarion call Dyson warns us that we can only find redemption as a society if we acknowledge that Katrina was more than an engineering or emergency response failure. From the TV newsroom to the Capitol Building to the backyard, we must change the way we relate to the black and the poor among us.

Allison""]",3.53,131,18.0,"Here is a brisk, accessible, and vivid introduction to arguably the most important event in the history of the United States--the American Revolution.

Between 1760 and 1800, the American people cast off British rule to create a new nation and a radically new form of government based on the idea that people have the right to govern themselves. In this lively account, Robert Allison provides a cohesive synthesis of the military, diplomatic, political, social, and intellectual aspects of the Revolution, paying special attention to the Revolution's causes and consequences. The book recreates the tumultuous events of the 1760s and 1770s that led to revolution, such as the Boston Massacre and the Boston Tea Party, as well as the role the Sons of Liberty played in turning resistance into full-scale revolt. Allison explains how and why Americans changed their ideas of government and society so profoundly in these years and how the War for Independence was fought and won. He highlights the major battles and commanders on both sides--with a particular focus on George Washington and the extraordinary strategies he developed to defeat Britain's
superior forces--as well as the impact of French military support on the American cause. In the final chapter, Allison explores the aftermath of the American  how the newly independent states created governments based on the principles for which they had fought, and how those principles challenged their own institutions, such as slavery, in the new republic. He considers as well the Revolution's legacy, the many ways its essential ideals influenced other struggles against oppressive power or colonial systems in France, Latin America, and Asia.

Sharply written and highly readable, The American  A Very Short Introduction offers a concise introduction to this seminal event in American history.

Taken from Dyson's recent public lectures--delivered to audiences with no specialized knowledge in hard sciences--the book begins with a consideration of the practical and political questions surrounding biotechnology. As he seeks how best to explain the place of life in the universe, Dyson then moves from the ethical to the purely scientific. The book concludes with an attempt to understand the implications of biology for philosophy and religion.

The pieces in this collection touch on numerous disciplines, from astronomy and ecology to neurology and theology, speaking to the lay reader as well as to the scientist.

Kelly reveals the technological advances that led us to the system of notation we use today, placing each step of its evolution in its cultural and intellectual context.

They often set about trying to convert one another, considering the faith the other holds as defective in some critical way. Unfortunately, much of what they say about one another simply isn't true. False stereotypes abound on both sides, preventing genuine and helpful communication. Having discovered this sad state of affairs, Craig Blomberg, a committed evangelical scholar, and Stephen Robinson, a committed Mormon scholar, set out to listen to one another and to ferret out the real agreements and disagreements between them.

What they agree on may surprise you. Though this book does not sweep differences under the rug, it is meant to help Mormons and evangelicals know and tell the truth about one another. It does not expect to end evangelistic efforts from either side. In fact, it may help to promote more effective communication because it can help to get rid of misrepresentations from both sides.

     What is the foundation underpinning success in all areas of life? Is there a blueprint? What if you learned that your beliefs were the very cornerstones that supported success, and that having a few of these could give rise to success in some areas while complete failure in others?  Would you choose to build a stronger overall foundation?

     Very few people today doubt the power of positive thinking. We all know that if we expect to fail, then failure is inevitably what we get, and there is also the issue of the mind/body connection—science is repeatedly demonstrating the power of mind and belief to heal. What you believe can and does have a huge impact on the quality of your life—from success in business to success in relationships, from your ability to learn and master new subjects to your ability to heal your own body. But have you ever stopped to consider your own beliefs—to truly examine them and decide for yourself if they are serving you or sabotaging you?

     Eldon Taylor has spent over 25 years researching the power of the mind and developing scientifically proven methods to use this power to enhance the quality of your life. I Believe is a book that will not only inspire you, but will highlight the kinds of beliefs you hold that may be causing you to fail. In the process, it will provide you with the opportunity to choose, once again, the beliefs that drive your life.","[""Self Help"",""Spirituality"",""Nonfiction""]",3/15/2012,2012.0,"{""name"":""Eldon Taylor"",""num_books"":897,""num_followers"":""39""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":3,""reviews_percentage"":4},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":16,""reviews_percentage"":22},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":24,""reviews_percentage"":33},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":28,""reviews_percentage"":38}}","""$9.99""",internal,internal_focus,False

In the musty archive of a Belgian abbey, historian Craig Harline happened upon a vast collection of documents written in the seventeenth century by people who claimed to have experienced miracles and wonders. In Miracles at the Jesus Oak , Harline recasts five of these testimonies into engaging vignettes that open a window onto the believers, unbelievers, and religious movements of Catholic Europe in the Age of Reformation.

Miracles at the Jesus Oak transports readers to the seventeenth-century Spanish Netherlands and into the company of a flesh and blood and captivating set of people. Combining meticulous historical research and storytelling élan, Harline writes about the competition for pilgrims waged between a group of tailors and a group of nuns; takes readers inside the emotional turmoil of a young prostitute who secretly takes away a consecrated host from Mass; explores the political and religious ramifications that arise when a woman’s breasts miraculously fill with milk enabling her to feed a starving infant; and in the title story, describes how two towns fight each other for control of the miracle-working oak tree that lies between them.

Craig Harline’s previous books have won the praises of both the mainstream and the religious press. The Weekly Standard said A Bishop’s Tale “reads like the very best historical fiction . . . the history book of the year–and perhaps simply the book of the year.” Written with grace and charm, Miracles at the Jesus Oak is popular history at its most informative and enlightening.","[""History"",""Nonfiction"",""Religion""]",1/1/2003,2003.0,"{""name"":""Craig Harline"",""num_books"":11,""num_followers"":""6""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":0,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1,""reviews_percentage"":1},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":11,""reviews_percentage"":21},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":27,""reviews_percentage"":51},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":13,""reviews_percentage"":25}}","""$17.99""",external,external_focus,True

And Why They'll Take Us to the Brink Again,"[""Suzanne McGee""]",3.63,205,27.0,"You know what happened during the financial crisis … now it is time to understand why the financial system came so close to falling over the edge of the abyss and why it could happen again. Wall Street has been saved, but it hasn’t been reformed. What is the problem?

Suzanne McGee provides a penetrating look at the forces that transformed Wall Street from its traditional role as a capital-generating and economy-boosting engine into a behemoth operating with only its own short-term interests in mind and with reckless disregard for the broader financial system and those who relied on that system for their well being and prosperity.

Primary among these influences was “Goldman Sachs envy”: the self-delusion on the part of Richard Fuld of Lehman Brothers, Stanley O’Neil of Merrill Lynch, and other power brokers (egged on by their shareholders) that taking more risk would enable their companies to make even more money than Goldman Sachs. That hubris—and that narrow-minded focus on maximizing their short-term profits—led them to take extraordinary risks that they couldn’t manage and that later severely damaged, and in some cases destroyed, their businesses, wreaking havoc on the nation’s economy and millions of 401(k)s in the process.

In a world that boasted more hedge funds than Taco Bell outlets, McGee demonstrates how it became ever harder for Wall Street to fulfill its function as the financial system’s version of a power grid, with capital, rather than electricity, flowing through it. But just as a power grid can be strained beyond its capacity, so too can a “financial grid” collapse if its functions are distorted, as happened with Wall Street as it became increasingly self-serving and motivated solely by short-term profits. Through probing analysis, meticulous research, and dozens of interviews with the bankers, traders, research analysts, and investment managers who have been on the front lines of financial booms and busts, McGee provides a practical understanding of our financial “utility,” and how it touches everyone directly as an investor and indirectly through the power—capital—that makes the economy work.

Wall Street is as important to the economy and the overall functioning of our society as our electric and water utilities. But it doesn’t act that way. The financial system has been saved from destruction but as long as the mind-set of “chasing Goldman Sachs” lingers, it will not have been reformed. As banking undergoes its biggest transformation since the 1929 crash and the Great Depression, McGee shows where it stands today and points to where it needs to go next, examining the future of those financial institutions supposedly “too big to fail.”","[""Finance"",""Nonfiction"",""Business"",""Economics"",""History"",""Politics""]",1/1/2010,2010.0,"{""name"":""Suzanne McGee"",""num_books"":3,""num_followers"":""13""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":4,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":12,""reviews_percentage"":5},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":71,""reviews_percentage"":34},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":87,""reviews_percentage"":42},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":31,""reviews_percentage"":15}}","""$14.99""",external,external_focus,True

Bailey""]",3.44,88,13.0,"When did English become American? What distinctive qualities made it American? What role have America's democratizing impulses, and its vibrantly heterogeneous speakers, played in shaping our language and separating it from the mother tongue? 

A wide-ranging account of American English, Richard Bailey's Speaking American investigates the history and continuing evolution of our language from the sixteenth century to the present. The book is organized in half-century segments around influential centers: Chesapeake Bay (1600-1650), Boston (1650-1700), Charleston (1700-1750), Philadelphia (1750-1800), New Orleans (1800-1850), New York (1850-1900), Chicago (1900-1950), Los Angeles (1950-2000), and Cyberspace (2000-present). Each of these places has added new words, new inflections, new ways of speaking to the elusive, boisterous, ever-changing linguistic experiment that is American English. Freed from British constraints of unity and propriety, swept up in rapid social change, restless movement, and a thirst for innovation, Americans have always been eager to invent new words, from earthy frontier expressions like ""catawampously"" (vigorously) and ""bung-nipper"" (pickpocket), to West African words introduced by slaves such as ""goober"" (peanut) and ""gumbo"" (okra), to urban slang such as ""tagging"" (spraying graffiti) and ""crew"" (gang). Throughout, Bailey focuses on how people speak and how speakers change the language. The book is filled with transcripts of arresting voices, precisely situated in time and space: two justices of the peace sitting in a pumpkin patch trying an Indian for theft; a crowd of Africans lounging on the waterfront in Philadelphia discussing the newly independent nation in their home languages; a Chicago gangster complaining that his pocket had been picked; Valley Girls chattering; Crips and Bloods negotiating their gang identities in LA; and more. Speaking American explores--and celebrates--the endless variety and remarkable inventiveness that have always been at the heart of American English.","[""Nonfiction"",""Linguistics"",""History"",""Language""]",12/1/2011,2011.0,"{""name"":""Richard W.

Dennett""]",3.9,761,66.0,"Anyone who has wondered if free will is just an illusion or has asked 'could I have chosen otherwise?' after performing some rash deed will find this book an absorbing discussion of an endlessly fascinating subject. Daniel Dennett, whose previous books include ""Brainstorms ""and (with Douglas Hofstadter) ""The Mind's I, "" tackles the free will problem in a highly original and witty manner, drawing on the theories and concepts of several fields usually ignored by philosophers; not just physics and evolutionary biology, but engineering, automata theory, and artificial intelligence.

In ""Elbow Room,"" Dennett shows how the classical formulations of the problem in philosophy depend on misuses of imagination, and he disentangles the philosophical problems of real interest from the ""family of anxieties' they get enmeshed in - imaginary agents, bogeymen, and dire prospects that seem to threaten our freedom. Putting sociobiology in its rightful place, he concludes that we can have free will and science too. ""Elbow Room"" begins by showing how we can be ""moved by reasons"" without being exempt from physical causation. It goes on to analyze concepts of control and self-control-concepts often skimped by philosophers but which are central to the questions of free will and determinism. A chapter on ""self-made selves"" discusses the idea of self or agent to see how it can be kept from disappearing under the onslaught of science. Dennett then sees what can be made of the notion of acting under the idea of freedomdoes the elbow room we think we have really exist? What is an opportunity, and how can anything in our futures be ""up to us""? He investigates the meaning of ""can"" and ""could have done otherwise,"" and asks why we want free will in the first place.We are wise, Dennett notes, to want free will, but that in itself raises a host of questions about responsibility. In a final chapter, he takes up the problem of how anyone can ever be guilty, and what the rationale is for holding people responsible and even, on occasion, punishing them.

Deborah Cadbury explores the history behind the epic monuments that spanned the industrial revolution from Brunel's extraordinary Great Eastern, the Titanic of its day that joined the two ends of the empire, to the Panama Canal, that linked the Atlantic and Pacific oceans half a century later. Seven Wonders of the Industrial World recreates the stories of the most brilliant pioneers of the industrial age, their burning ambitions and extravagant dreams, their passions and rivalries as great minds clashed. These were men such as Arthur Powell-Davis, the engineer behind the Hoover Dam, who dreamed of creating the largest dam in the world by diverting the entire Colorado river, one of the worlds most dangerous and unpredictable, or John Roebling, who lost his life creating the Brooklyn Bridge, the longest suspension bridge ever built. These are also the stories of countless unsung heroes -- the craftsmen and workers without whose perseverance nothing would have been achieved, not to mention the financiers and shareholders hanging on for the ride as fortunes -- and reputations -- were lost and won. Cadbury leads us on an amazing journey from the freezing snows of the Alps to the mosquito-ridden wilds of the Central American jungle as we see uncontrollable rivers tamed, continents conquered and vast oceans joined.","[""History"",""Nonfiction"",""Engineering"",""Science"",""Technology"",""World History""]",1/1/2003,2003.0,"{""name"":""Deborah Cadbury"",""num_books"":15,""num_followers"":""168""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":3,""reviews_percentage"":1},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":45,""reviews_percentage"":21},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":75,""reviews_percentage"":36},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":82,""reviews_percentage"":39}}","""$4.49""",external,external_focus,True

Anthony Lukas, High-Risers braids personal narratives, city politics, and national history to tell the timely and epic story of Chicago’s Cabrini-Green, America’s most iconic public housing project.

Built in the 1940s atop an infamous Italian slum, Cabrini-Green grew to twenty-three towers and a population of 20,000—all of it packed onto just seventy acres a few blocks from Chicago’s ritzy Gold Coast. Cabrini-Green became synonymous with crime, squalor, and the failure of government. For the many who lived there, it was also a much-needed resource—it was home. By 2011, every high-rise had been razed, the island of black poverty engulfed by the white affluence around it, the families dispersed.

In this novelistic and eye-opening narrative, Ben Austen tells the story of America’s public housing experiment and the changing fortunes of American cities. It is an account told movingly though the lives of residents who struggled to make a home for their families as powerful forces converged to accelerate the housing complex’s demise. Beautifully written, rich in detail, and full of moving portraits, High-Risers is a sweeping exploration of race, class, popular culture, and politics in modern America that brilliantly considers what went wrong in our nation’s effort to provide affordable housing to the poor—and what we can learn from those mistakes.","[""Nonfiction"",""History"",""Politics"",""Sociology"",""Social Justice"",""Cities"",""Urban Studies"",""Urbanism"",""Urban Planning"",""Race""]",2/6/2018,2018.0,"{""name"":""Ben Austen"",""num_books"":5,""num_followers"":""24""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":5,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":26,""reviews_percentage"":1},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":186,""reviews_percentage"":10},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":734,""reviews_percentage"":41},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":822,""reviews_percentage"":46}}","""$14.39""",external,external_focus,False

Naples is always a shock, flaunting beauty and squalor like nowhere else. Naples is the only city in Europe whose ancient past still lives in its irrepressible people. Their ancestors came from all over the early Mediterranean to the wide bay and its islands, shadowed by a dormant volcano. Not all of them found what they were looking for, but they made a great and terribly human city. Peter Robb's Street Fight in Naples ranges across nearly three thousand years of Neapolitan life and art, from the first Greeklandings in Italy to his own less auspicious arrival thirty-something years ago.

In 1503 Naples became the Mediterranean capital of Spain's world empire and the base for the Christian struggle with Islam. It was a European metropolis matched only by Paris and Istanbul, an extraordinary concentration of military power, lavish consumption, poverty and desperation. As the occupying empire went into crisis, exhausted by its wars against Islamists in the Mediterranean and Protestants in the North, the people of Naples paid a dreadful price.

Naples was where in 1606 the greatest painter of his age fled from Rome after a fatal street fight. Michelangelo Merisi from Caravaggio found in its teeming streets an image of the age's crisis, and released among the painters of Naples the energies of a great age in European art - until everything erupted in a revolt by the dispossessed, and the people of an occupied city brought Europe into the modern world.","[""History"",""Nonfiction"",""Travel"",""Italy"",""Art"",""European History"",""Unfinished"",""Memoir""]",1/1/2010,2010.0,"{""name"":""Peter Robb"",""num_books"":23,""num_followers"":""40""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":3,""reviews_percentage"":2},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":10,""reviews_percentage"":6},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":48,""reviews_percentage"":33},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":50,""reviews_percentage"":34},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":33,""reviews_percentage"":22}}",,external,external_focus,True

As the '75 season ended, Hunt was out of Formula 1 racing while Lauda was world champion and the odds-on favorite for ’76 with a year’s contract ahead of him and Enzo Ferrari begging him to sign a multi-year deal. James Hunt, without a drive until Emerson Fittipaldi broke his McLaren contract, grabbed the McLaren drive with both hands and the help of friend John Hogan and Marlboro cigarettes. The result? Two drivers in an epic sixteen-race battle across the globe for the '76 title, ultimately decided by a single point.

Fame, wealth, drugs, sex, and the rest of globetrotting 1970s Formula 1 racing are encompassed in the Lauda vs. Hunt duel. At the '76 German Grand Prix, Lauda nearly died in a fiery crash, only to emerge six weeks later, severe burns on his face and head, to pursue his rivalry with Hunt. It all came down to the last race, a rain-soaked affair in Japan, where Hunt won the championship by the slimmest possible margin.

The book is a study in contrasts during an era of Brut aftershave and disco sex parties. James Hunt, legendary philanderer and Formula 1 rock star, versus supernatural racer Niki Lauda, who in '75 set the first sub-seven minute lap around the Ring. ","[""Sports"",""Nonfiction"",""Biography"",""History""]",11/1/2011,2011.0,"{""name"":""Tom Rubython"",""num_books"":16,""num_followers"":""9""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":14,""reviews_percentage"":3},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":74,""reviews_percentage"":19},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":136,""reviews_percentage"":36},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":146,""reviews_percentage"":39}}",,external,external_focus,False

In this book William Sitwell, culinary expert on BBC2's 'A Question of Taste' and editor of Waitrose Kitchen magazine, takes us on a colourful, whirlwind journey as he explores the fascinating history of cuisine. This book is a celebration of the great dishes, techniques and above all brilliant cooks who have, over the centuries, created the culinary landscape we now enjoy.

Probing the dialectics of innovation, diversity, continuity, and unity throughout surrealism's international presence, Morning Star also incorporates analyses of Claude Cahun, Guy Debord, Pierre Naville, José Carlos Mariátegui and others, accompanied by numerous reproductions of surrealist art.

Although she passed away before she could complete her life’s work, some of her colleagues have organized her pioneering contributions into this provocative book.In three parts, Cordova sets out a complete Native American philosophy. First she explains her own understanding of the nature of reality itself—the origins of the world, the relation of matter and spirit, the nature of time, and the roles of culture and language in understanding all of these. She then turns to our role as residents of the Earth, arguing that we become human as we deepen our relation to our people and to our places, and as we understand the responsibilities that grow from those relationships. In the final section, she calls for a new reverence in a world where there is no distinction between the sacred and the mundane.Cordova clearly contrasts Native American beliefs with the traditions of the Enlightenment and Christianized Europeans (what she calls “Euroman” philosophy). By doing so, she leads her readers into a deeper understanding of both traditions and encourages us to question any view that claims a singular truth. From these essays—which are lucid, insightful, frequently funny, and occasionally angry—we receive a powerful new vision of how we can live with respect, reciprocity, and joy.","[""Philosophy"",""Nonfiction"",""Spirituality"",""Religion"",""Native Americans""]",10/1/2007,2007.0,"{""name"":""V.F.

Diligently treating the drug addicts of Vancouver's notorious Downtown Eastside with sympathy in his heart and legislative reform in mind can't be easy. But Maté never judges. His book is a powerful call-to-arms, both for the decriminalization of drugs and for a more sympathetic and informed view of addiction. As Maté observes, ""Those whom we dismiss as 'junkies' are not creatures from a different world, only men and women mired at the extreme end of a continuum on which, here or there, all of us might well locate ourselves."" In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts begins by introducing us to many of Dr. Maté's most dire patients who steal, cheat, sell sex, and otherwise harm themselves for their next hit. Maté looks to the root causes of addiction, applying a clinical and psychological view to the physical manifestation and offering some enlightening answers for why people inflict such catastrophe on themselves.

Finally, he takes aim at the hugely ineffectual, largely U.S.-led War on Drugs (and its worldwide followers), challenging the wisdom of fighting drugs instead of aiding the addicts, and showing how controversial measures such as safe injection sites are measurably more successful at reducing drug-related crime and the spread of disease than anything most major governments have going. It's not easy reading, but we ignore his arguments at our peril. When it comes to combating the drug trade and the ravages of addiction, society can use all the help it can get. --Kim Hughes","[""Psychology"",""Nonfiction"",""Health"",""Mental Health"",""Science"",""Self Help"",""Medicine"",""Audiobook"",""Social Work"",""Medical""]",2/12/2007,2007.0,"{""name"":""Gabor Maté"",""num_books"":42,""num_followers"":""6109""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":79,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":221,""reviews_percentage"":1},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1409,""reviews_percentage"":7},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":5603,""reviews_percentage"":30},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":11301,""reviews_percentage"":60}}","""$12.99""",internal,internal_focus,False

A leader in applying game theory to the understanding of institutional analysis, Elinor Ostrom provides in this book a coherent method for undertaking the analysis of diverse economic, political, and social institutions.

Understanding Institutional Diversity explains the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework, which enables a scholar to choose the most relevant level of interaction for a particular question. This framework examines the arena within which interactions occur, the rules employed by participants to order relationships, the attributes of a biophysical world that structures and is structured by interactions, and the attributes of a community in which a particular arena is placed.

The book explains and illustrates how to use the IAD in the context of both field and experimental studies. Concentrating primarily on the rules aspect of the IAD framework, it provides empirical evidence about the diversity of rules, the calculation process used by participants in changing rules, and the design principles that characterize robust, self-organized resource governance institutions.","[""Economics"",""Politics"",""Political Science"",""Nonfiction"",""Textbooks"",""Philosophy"",""Academic"",""Environment""]",1/1/2005,2005.0,"{""name"":""Elinor Ostrom"",""num_books"":79,""num_followers"":""187""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":2,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":6,""reviews_percentage"":5},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":20,""reviews_percentage"":19},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":30,""reviews_percentage"":29},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":44,""reviews_percentage"":43}}","""$29.99""",external,internal_focus,True

Freehling""]",4.16,276,27.0,"Far from a monolithic block of diehard slave states, the South in the eight decades before the Civil War was, in William Freehling's words, ""a world so lushly various as to be a storyteller's dream."" It was a world where Deep South cotton planters clashed with South Carolina rice growers, where the egalitarian spirit sweeping the North seeped down through border states already uncertain about slavery, where even sections of the same state (for instance, coastal and mountain Virginia) divided bitterly on key issues. It was the world of Jefferson Davis, John C. Calhoun, Andrew Jackson, and Thomas Jefferson, and also of Gullah Jack, Nat Turner, and Frederick Douglass.  Now, in the first volume of his long awaited, monumental study of the South's road to disunion, historian William Freehling offers a sweeping political and social history of the antebellum South from 1776 to 1854. All the dramatic events leading to secession are here: the Missouri Compromise, the Nullification Controversy, the Gag Rule (""the Pearl Harbor of the slavery controversy""), the Annexation of Texas, the Compromise of 1850, and the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Freehling vividly recounts each crisis, illuminating complex issues and sketching colorful portraits of major figures. Along the way, he reveals the surprising extent to which slavery influenced national politics before 1850, and he provides important reinterpretations of American republicanism, Jeffersonian states' rights, Jacksonian democracy, and the causes of the American Civil War.  But for all Freehling's brilliant insight into American antebellum politics, Secessionists at Bay is at bottom the saga of the rich social tapestry of the pre-war South. He takes us to old Charleston, Natchez, and Nashville, to the big house of a typical plantation, and we feel anew the tensions between the slaveowner and his family, the poor whites and the planters, the established South and the newer South, and especially between the slave and his master, ""Cuffee"" and ""Massa."" Freehling brings the Old South back to life in all its color, cruelty, and diversity. It is a memorable portrait, certain to be a key analysis of this crucial era in American history.","[""History"",""Civil War"",""American History"",""Nonfiction"",""Politics"",""American Civil War"",""War"",""Race"",""American"",""The United States Of America""]",9/6/1990,1990.0,"{""name"":""William W.

In this insightful and absorbing book, distinguished historian and classical scholar Michael Grant demonstrates the dynamic effect that ancient mythology has had on the creative efforts of succeding centuries. He summarizes all the myths as well as the legends of the lesser gods and heroes, and traces their origins in historical fact or religious myth. He then shows how myths have continued to evolve throughout the ages. The author's brilliant investigations lead from Pericles to Picasso, Homer to Freud, Apuleius to Grimm - and prove that mythological themes have been continuously restated in art, science, and folklore, up to the present day.

In The Pashtuns, Abubakar Siddique, a stout-hearted Pashtun himself, sets out to interrogate this claim. He tells a very different story: That the failure and unwillingness, of both Afghanistan and Pakistan to absorb the Pashtuns into their state structures and to incorporate them into the economic and political fabric is central to South Asia's problems and a critical failure of nation- and state-building in both countries.

In a voice that is both engaging and erudite, he makes clear that religious extremism is the product of these critical failures and that responsibility for this lies to a large degree with the elites of both countries.

Bush, An Inside Account","[""David Frum""]",3.48,362,24.0,"The Right Man is the first inside account of a historic year in the Bush White House, by the presidential speechwriter credited with the phrase axis of evil. David Frum helped make international headlines when President George W. Bush’s 2002 State of the Union address linked international terrorists to Iran, Iraq, and North Korea. But that was only one moment during a crucial time in American history, when a president, an administration, and a country were transformed.

Frum worked with President Bush in the Oval Office, traveled with him aboard Air Force One, and studied him closely at meetings and events. He describes how Bush thinks—what this conservative president believes about religion, race, the environment, Jews, Muslims, and America’s future. Frum takes us behind the scenes of one of the most secretive administrations in recent history, with revealing portraits of Karl Rove, Karen Hughes, Condoleezza Rice, and many others. Most significant, he tells the story of the transformation of George W.  how a president whose administration began in uncertainty became one of the most decisive, successful, and popular leaders of our time.

Before becoming a White House speechwriter, David Frum was a highly regarded author of books and political commentary and an influential voice on the pages of The Wall Street Journal and The Weekly Standard. His commentary has been described by William F. Buckley as “the most refreshing ideological experience in a generation.” Now, in The Right Man, we see Frum as a front-row observer and participant. Not since Peggy Noonan’s account of her time in the Reagan White House has an insider portrayed a sitting president with such precision, verve, honest admiration, and insight.

The Right Man will command international attention for its thoughtful account of George W. Bush in the midst of his greatest challenge. It will be an essential reference for anyone seeking to understand who our president really is and how he is likely to lead us in the future.","[""Politics"",""Biography"",""Nonfiction"",""History"",""Presidents"",""Us Presidents"",""Historical"",""Biography Memoir"",""The United States Of America""]",1/1/2003,2003.0,"{""name"":""David Frum"",""num_books"":28,""num_followers"":""149""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":18,""reviews_percentage"":4},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":35,""reviews_percentage"":9},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":121,""reviews_percentage"":33},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":133,""reviews_percentage"":36},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":55,""reviews_percentage"":15}}","""$13.99""",external,internal_focus,True

Salibi offers a major reinterpretation of Lebanese history and provides remarkable insights into the dynamic of Lebanon's recent conflict.

Wilkins""]",4.38,53,11.0,"In Long Road to Hard  The 100 Year Mission to Create the National Museum of African American History and Culture , Robert L. Wilkins tells the story of how his curiosity about why there wasn't a national museum dedicated to African American history and culture became an obsession-eventually leading him to quit his job as an attorney when his wife was seven months pregnant with their second child, and make it his mission to help the museum become a reality. Long Road to Hard Truth chronicles the early history, when staunch advocates sought to create a monument for Black soldiers fifty years after the end of the Civil War and in response to the pervasive indignities of the time, including lynching, Jim Crow segregation, and the slander of the racist film Birth of a Nation. The movement soon evolved to envision creating a national museum, and Wilkins follows the endless obstacles through the decades, culminating in his honor of becoming a member of the Presidential Commission that wrote the plan for creating the museum and how, with support of both Black and White Democrats and Republicans, Congress finally authorized the museum. In September 2016, exactly 100 years after the movement to create it began, the Smithsonian will open the National Museum of African American History and Culture.

Some singularity theorists predict that if the field of artificial intelligence (AI) continues to develop at its current dizzying rate, the singularity could come about in the middle of the present century. Murray Shanahan offers an introduction to the idea of the singularity and considers the ramifications of such a potentially seismic event. Shanahan's aim is not to make predictions but rather to investigate a range of scenarios. Whether we believe that singularity is near or far, likely or impossible, apocalypse or utopia, the very idea raises crucial philosophical and pragmatic questions, forcing us to think seriously about what we want as a species. Shanahan describes technological advances in AI, both biologically inspired and engineered from scratch. Once human-level AI -- theoretically possible, but difficult to accomplish -- has been achieved, he explains, the transition to superintelligent AI could be very rapid. Shanahan considers what the existence of superintelligent machines could mean for such matters as personhood, responsibility, rights, and identity. Some superhuman AI agents might be created to benefit humankind; some might go rogue. (Is Siri the template, or HAL?) The singularity presents both an existential threat to humanity and an existential opportunity for humanity to transcend its limitations. Shanahan makes it clear that we need to imagine both possibilities if we want to bring about the better outcome.","[""Science"",""Nonfiction"",""Technology"",""Artificial Intelligence"",""Philosophy"",""Computer Science"",""Futurism"",""Popular Science"",""Computers"",""Society""]",8/7/2015,2015.0,"{""name"":""Murray Shanahan"",""num_books"":5,""num_followers"":""16""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":4,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":38,""reviews_percentage"":7},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":129,""reviews_percentage"":24},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":235,""reviews_percentage"":44},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":125,""reviews_percentage"":23}}","""$14.99""",external,external_focus,True

Heart Intelligence links the physical heart to the spiritual (energetic) heart. Through its extensive communication with the brain and body, the heart is intimately involved in how we think, feel, and respond to the world. Expanding on their breakthrough book, The HeartMath Solution, the authors offer heart-based techniques and guidelines for living from the heart, which connects the puzzle pieces of our purpose and fulfillment. The book provides information and simple practices for accessing our heart’s intuitive guidance to connect with our highest choices for better outcomes. Our choices are especially important through these changing times because they constantly create or disrupt our peace, happiness and self-security. Our thoughts and feelings influence the chemistry that regulates much of our health — how we feel, for better or worse. Our thoughts, feelings, emotions and attitudes are just frequencies that we can learn to change — once we put our heart into our intention. Heart Intelligence provides practices to replace fear with the attitude of intelligent concern (managed concern) which leaves us in charge and more attuned to intuitive direction. We learn the benefits of practicing simple coherence techniques a few times a day for boosting resilience and emotional balance; making appropriate choices; and clearing our mind from anxiety or overwhelm when needed.

This authoritative account of their many exploits, drawn from the narratives of the men themselves, makes compelling reading.

Whom do they eavesdrop on? And is the interception of communication an effective means of predicting and preventing future attacks? These are some of the questions at the heart of Patrick Radden Keefe’s brilliant new book, Chatter.

In the late 1990s, when Keefe was a graduate student in England, he heard stories about an eavesdropping network led by the United States that spanned the planet. The system, known as Echelon, allowed America and its allies to intercept the private phone calls and e-mails of civilians and governments around the world. Taking the mystery of Echelon as his point of departure, Keefe explores the nature and context of communications interception, drawing together fascinating strands of history, fresh investigative reporting, and riveting, eye-opening anecdotes. The result is a bold and distinctive book, part detective story, part travel-writing, part essay on paranoia and secrecy in a digital age.

Chatter starts out at Menwith Hill, a secret eavesdropping station covered in mysterious, gargantuan golf balls, in England’s Yorkshire moors. From there, the narrative moves quickly to another American spy station hidden in the Australian outback; from the intelligence bureaucracy in Washington to the European Parliament in Brussels; from an abandoned National Security Agency base in the mountains of North Carolina to the remote Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia.

As Keefe chases down the truth of contemporary surveillance by intelligence agencies, he unearths reams of little-known information and introduces us to a rogue’s gallery of unforgettable characters. We meet a former British eavesdropper who now listens in on the United States Air Force for sport; an intelligence translator who risked prison to reveal an American operation to spy on the United Nations Security Council; a former member of the Senate committee on intelligence who says that oversight is so bad, a lot of senators only sit on the committee for the travel.

Provocative, often funny, and alarming without being alarmist, Chatter is a journey through a bizarre and shadowy world with vast implications for our security as well as our privacy.

What if there is a way to easily apply spiritual teachings and manifestation techniques from diverse sources to instantly dissolve longstanding problems, challenges and roadblocks in your life? Can you compress the time it takes for your physical manifestations from a few months to a few minutes or less?In his latest book Spontaneous Manifestations From Zero, the world’s favorite manifestation author Richard Dotts lays the foundation by first explaining the Magic Transformation Process. Richard developed this process as an easy way for anyone to quickly integrate new spiritual teachings into their life and see fast results. Drawing on his own personal experiences and struggles with interpreting these esoteric teachings, the Magic Transformation Process bridges the gap between theory and practice by “transforming” any teaching into a form that is easily assimilated by our current belief system. The result is a high level of personal effectiveness and greatly improved success rates when learning any spiritual or self-help technique, such as those intended for instant manifestation or spiritual healing. Having laid this general groundwork for personal development, Richard moves on to explain why manifestations are not about taking a piecemeal approach. Many readers apply manifestation techniques in a piecemeal manner to fill up perceived voids in their lives. But as Richard explains, becoming an effective manifestor goes beyond just using these techniques when the need arises and neglecting them in other areas of your life. To become an effective manifestor, one needs to move towards an actual, holistic living of this material at all levels of their being instead of merely understanding it theoretically. To help readers do so, Richard expands upon the concept of timeless manifestations which he originally introduced in his book Playing In Time And Space. In this current book, Richard takes readers through a powerful series of inner exercises to “perceive our physical manifestations as the Universe sees it — at a single point in time.” Most readers have a difficult time understanding why time and space boundaries do not matter to the Universe and how time is only a convenient illusion when it comes to our manifestations. Through the steps described by Richard, readers are guided to see why instant spontaneous manifestations are not just a fantasy but a definite possibility in our everyday experience. Next, Richard shares the Quick Statement Process, a powerful technique that allows readers to cut through any negative feelings, emotions or thoughts arising from particular situations in their own life. These negative feelings often delay and hold our manifestations back, which is why it is important that we break free from them as soon as possible. The Quick Statement Process allows one to dissolve any negative feelings of doubt without the need for any logical rationalizations or psychoanalysis. Just drop it and be done with them! Readers are in for a treat as Richard rounds up the book by showing readers how to “collapse” their perceptions of time and space — such that they are both living in their current reality and also a “future” reality where their desires are already manifest. He shares his latest insights on why worrisome and fearful thoughts just cannot exist when we “collapse the future into the now” and live in a state of perpetual bliss.","[""Spirituality"",""Self Help""]",7/10/2015,2015.0,"{""name"":""Richard Dotts"",""num_books"":40,""num_followers"":""127""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":3,""reviews_percentage"":2},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":2,""reviews_percentage"":1},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":6,""reviews_percentage"":5},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":23,""reviews_percentage"":19},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":82,""reviews_percentage"":70}}","""$3.99""",internal,internal_focus,False

""This manual for self-realization comes not from a mountain but from the mud.... My qualification is not that I am better than you but I am worse."" (Russell Brand)

With a rare mix of honesty, humor, and compassion, comedian and movie star Russell Brand mines his own wild story and shares the advice and wisdom he has gained through his 14 years of recovery. Brand speaks to those suffering along the full spectrum of addiction - from drugs, alcohol, caffeine, and sugar addictions to addictions to work, stress, bad relationships, digital media, and fame. Brand understands that addiction can take many shapes and sizes and how the process of staying clean, sane, and unhooked is a daily activity. He believes that the question is not ""why are you addicted?"" but ""what pain is your addiction masking? Why are you running - into the wrong job, the wrong life, the wrong person's arms?""

Russell has been in all the 12-step fellowships going, he's started his own men's group, he's a therapy regular and a practiced yogi - and while he's worked on this material as part of his comedy and previous best sellers, he's never before shared the tools that really took him out of it, that keep him clean and clear. Here he provides not only a recovery plan but an attempt to make sense of the ailing world.

In this groundbreaking and timely book, Goodhart shows us how people have come to be divided into two camps: the 'Anywheres', who have 'achieved' identities, derived from their careers and education, and 'Somewheres', who get their identity from a sense of place and from the people around them, and who feel a sense of loss due to mass immigration and rapid social change.

The favoured murder weapon was the cut-throat razor; carrying a pocket watch was dangerous; the most significant clue at a murder scene could be the whereabouts of a candlestick or hat; large households (family, servants and lodgers) complicated many a case and servants sometimes murdered their masters. Detectives had few aids and suffered many disadvantages. The bloody handprints found at two early murder scenes were of no help, there being no way of telling whether blood (or hair) was human or animal. Fingerprinting was fifty years away, DNA profiling another hundred and photography was too new to help with identification. All reports had to be handwritten with a dip pen and ink and the only means of keeping contact with colleagues and disseminating information was by post, horseback or foot. In spite of these handicaps and severe press criticism, the detectives achieved some significant successes. Joan Lock includes such classic cases as the First Railway Murder, as well as many fascinating, fresh reports, weaving in new developments like the electric telegraph against a background of authentic Victorian police procedure. Charles Dickens said that Scotland Yard detectives gave the impression of leading lives of strong mental excitement. Readers of this book will understand why.

Paracuellos is a work of great courage, created at a time when telling the truth about Spain's political past could get one killed. It is arguably the most important graphic memoir ever created in comics.  Carlos Gimenez s autobiographical account of the plight of children in post-World War II Fascist Spain has won virtually every comics award in Europe, including Best Album at the 1981 Angouleme Festival, and the Heritage Award atAngouleme in 2010.  In the late 1930s when Spanish fascists led by Franco, and aided by Hitler and Mussolini, overthrew the elected government, almost 200,000 men and women fell in battle, were executed, or died in prison. Their orphaned children and others ripped from the homes of the defeated were shuttled from Church-run home to home and fed a steady diet of torture and disinformation by a totalitarian state bent on making them productive citizens.  Carlos Gimenez was one of those children. In 1975, after Franco s death, Carlos began to tell his story. Breaking the code of silence proved to be a milestone, both for the comics medium and for a country coming to terms with its past.  An illustrated essay by Carmen Moreno-Nuno, Associate Professor of Hispanic Studies at the University of Kentucky, places the comics in historical perspective.

Bloodsport is the story of how the mania for corporate deals and mergers all began. The riveting tale of how power lawyers Joe Flom and Marty Lipton, major Wall Street players Felix Rohatyn and Bruce Wasserstein, prominent jurists, and shrewd ideologues in academic garb provided the intellectual firepower, creativity, and energy that drove the corporate elite into a less cozy, Hobbesian world.

With total dollar volume in the trillions, the zeal for the deal continues unabated to this day. Underpinning this explosion in mergers and acquisitions -- including hostile takeovers -- are four questions that radically disrupted corporate ownership in the 1970s, whose force remains 

Are shareholders the sole ""owners"" of corporations and the legitimate source of power?
Should control be exercised by autonomous CEOs or is their assumption of power illegitimate and inefficient?
Is the primary purpose of the corporation to generate jobs and create prosperity for the masses and the nation?
Or is it simply to maximize the wealth of shareholders?

The spy planes were driving Nikita Khrushchev mad. Whenever America wanted to peer inside the Soviet Union, it launched a U-2, which flew too high to be shot down. But Sergei Korolev, Russia's chief rocket designer, had a riposte: an artificial satellite that would orbit the earth and cross American skies at will. On October 4, 1957, the launch of Korolev's satellite, Sputnik, stunned the world.

In Red Moon Rising, Matthew Brzezinski takes us inside the Kremlin, the White House, secret military facilities, and the halls of Congress to bring to life the Russians and Americans who feared and distrusted their compatriots as much as their superpower rivals. Drawing on original interviews and new documentary sources from both sides of the Cold War divide, he shows how Khrushchev and Dwight Eisenhower were buffeted by crises of their own creation, leaving the door open to ambitious politicians and scientists to squabble over the heavens and the earth. It is a story rich in the paranoia of the time, with combatants that included two future presidents, survivors of the gulag, corporate chieftains, rehabilitated Nazis, and a general who won the day by refusing to follow orders.

Sputnik set in motion events that led not only to the moon landing but also to cell phones, federally guaranteed student loans, and the wireless Internet.

Stepping over the lines imposed by rigid conviction, she draws on philosophy, theology, psychology, science, and more to explore, with curiosity and passion, the vital role of mystery in a deceptively information-rich world; to ask what we mean by the search for meaning; to invoke the humbling yet elating perspective of infinity; to challenge received ideas about death; and to reconsider what “the soul” might be.

But it turns out we have only scratched the surface. Scholar David Day has spent many years down the rabbit hole of this children's classic and has emerged with a revelatory new view of its contents. What we have here, he brilliantly and persuasively argues, is a complete classical education in coded form--Carroll's gift to his ""wonder child"" Alice Liddell.      In two continuous commentaries, woven around the complete text of the novel for ease of cross-reference on every page, David Day reveals the many layers of teaching, concealed by manipulation of language, that are carried so lightly in the beguiling form of a fairy tale. These layers relate directly to Carroll's interest in philosophy, history, mathematics, classics, poetry, spiritualism and even to his love of music--both sacred and profane. His novel is a memory palace, given to Alice as the great gift of an education. It was delivered in coded form because in that age, it was a gift no girl would be permitted to receive in any other way.     Day also shows how a large number of the characters in the book are based on real Victorians. Wonderland, he shows, is a veritable ""Who's Who"" of Oxford at the height of its power and influence in the Victorian Age.     There is so much to be found behind the imaginary characters and creatures that inhabit the pages of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. David Day's warm, witty and brilliantly insightful guide--beautifully designed and stunningly illustrated throughout in full colour--will make you marvel at the book as never before.","[""Nonfiction"",""Classics"",""History"",""Books About Books"",""Literature"",""Childrens"",""Philosophy"",""Art"",""Criticism"",""Fairy Tales""]",3/31/2015,2015.0,"{""name"":""David Day"",""num_books"":260,""num_followers"":""231""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":2,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":4,""reviews_percentage"":3},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":29,""reviews_percentage"":24},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":40,""reviews_percentage"":33},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":44,""reviews_percentage"":36}}",,external,external_focus,True

acclaimed author Robert L. Glass explores a critical, yet strangely neglected, question: What is the role of creativity in software engineering and computer programming? With his trademark easy-to-read style and practical approach, backed by research and personal experience, Glass takes on a wide range of related angles and implications. To name only a few: 

* Are discipline and formality at odds with flexibility and agility? 
* When are control-driven vs. experimentation-driven approaches most effective? 
* Can we ""make creativity happen"" in a software organization? 
* Which is more important, process or product? 
* How do theory and practice interact in the software field? Can practitioners and academe complement each other more effectively? 
* Is there a missing link between creativity and software design? 
* What is the balance of ""intellectual"" and ""clerical"" tasks in software work? 
* Can we still find a place for plain old fun?

In her examination of the cultural forms to which these affects give rise, Sianne Ngai suggests that these minor and more politically ambiguous feelings become all the more suited for diagnosing the character of late modernity.

Along with her inquiry into the aesthetics of unprestigious negative affects such as irritation, envy, and disgust, Ngai examines a racialized affect called “animatedness,” and a paradoxical synthesis of shock and boredom called “stuplimity.” She explores the politically equivocal work of these affective concepts in the cultural contexts where they seem most at stake, from academic feminist debates to the Harlem Renaissance, from late-twentieth-century American poetry to Hollywood film and network television. Through readings of Herman Melville, Nella Larsen, Sigmund Freud, Alfred Hitchcock, Gertrude Stein, Ralph Ellison, John Yau, and Bruce Andrews, among others, Ngai shows how art turns to ugly feelings as a site for interrogating its own suspended agency in the affirmative culture of a market society, where art is tolerated as essentially unthreatening.

Ngai mobilizes the aesthetics of ugly feelings to investigate not only ideological and representational dilemmas in literature—with a particular focus on those inflected by gender and race—but also blind spots in contemporary literary and cultural criticism. Her work maps a major intersection of literary studies, media and cultural studies, feminist studies, and aesthetic theory.","[""Philosophy"",""Nonfiction"",""Theory"",""Essays"",""Criticism"",""Art"",""Psychology"",""Literary Criticism"",""Research"",""Cultural Studies""]",2/28/2005,2005.0,"{""name"":""Sianne Ngai"",""num_books"":11,""num_followers"":""128""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":4,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":12,""reviews_percentage"":2},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":62,""reviews_percentage"":15},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":147,""reviews_percentage"":36},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":176,""reviews_percentage"":43}}","""$16.50""",external,external_focus,False

A book of meditations about man’s relation with God, it is not a work of dry theology, but rather a book of prayerful reflections on love, knowledge, and faith, obedience, everyday routines, life with our friends and neighbors, our work and vocation, and human goodness. The immense success of this moving work is a tribute to its practicality and the ability of the great theologian to speak simply and yet profoundly to ordinary men and women seeking an inspiring guide to the inner life, one that never forsakes the world of reality. The book is cast in the form of a dialogue with God that moves from humble but concerned inquiry to joyful contemplation. “You will come again because the fact that you have already come must continue to be revealed ever more clearly. It must become progressively manifest to the world that the heart of all things is already transformed, because you have taken them all to your heart. . . .

BY THE SUMMER of 2007, Britain was close to crashing. A few onlookers realised the danger, but Britain's political leaders were not among them. Politicians and civil servants boasted that the City's economy was booming because of their 'light-touch regulation' of workers in financial services whose number included potential frauds. Curiously, they never argued that the inner-city economy might boom if there was 'light touch regulation' of workers in the ghettos whose number included potential drug dealers.And artists produced works to match the times. On the same day that Lehman Brothers went bankrupt, the genial Damien Hirst auctioned at Sotheby's pieces he admitted had been mass produced in his studios and buyers still gave him £100 million. Even the critics did not pretend to be interested in what message, if any, Hirst had for his audience, but reported the sale like business reporters covering a soaring stock.For 10 years New Labour stood cross-eyed in admiration as London was turned into the centre of the financial universe. From the sand bags Nick Cohen has watched as they turned their back on the working class, once the object of Utopian hopes on the Left and unreasonable fears on the Right, and lovingly embraced the upper class, once the object of surly contempt on the Left. In Waiting for the Etonians are gathered his selected writings that cover the span of Labour's love affair with the Right and the moral hazard that it has culminated in. It is a romance which has not only broken its traditional bond with the working classes and undermined the very values on which the party was founded, but has now left it with little more to do than warm the seat for the next Conservative Prime Minister.","[""Politics"",""History"",""Nonfiction""]",2/19/2009,2009.0,"{""name"":""Nick Cohen"",""num_books"":19,""num_followers"":""62""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":4,""reviews_percentage"":5},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":4,""reviews_percentage"":5},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":17,""reviews_percentage"":22},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":33,""reviews_percentage"":43},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":18,""reviews_percentage"":23}}","""$0.99""",external,external_focus,True

The deeply reported story of two trailblazers who share a common sense of their historic destiny but hold very different beliefs about how to project American power—from veteran New York Times White House correspondent Mark Landler

In the annals of American statecraft, theirs was a most unlikely alliance. Clinton, daughter of an anticommunist father, was raised in the Republican suburbs of Chicago in the aftermath of World War II, nourishing an unshakable belief in the United States as a force for good in distant lands. Obama, an itinerant child of the 1970s, was raised by a single mother in Indonesia and Hawaii, suspended between worlds and a witness to the less savory side of Uncle Sam’s influence abroad. Clinton and Obama would later come to embody competing visions of America’s role in the  his, restrained, inward-looking, painfully aware of limits; hers, hard-edged, pragmatic, unabashedly old-fashioned.
 
Spanning the arc of Obama’s two terms, Alter Egos goes beyond the speeches and press conferences to the Oval Office huddles and South Lawn strolls, where Obama and Clinton pressed their views. It follows their evolution from bitter rivals to wary partners, and then to something resembling rivals again, as Clinton defined herself anew and distanced herself from her old boss. In the process, it counters the narrative that, during her years as secretary of state, there was no daylight between them, that the wounds of the 2008 campaign had been entirely healed.
 
The president and his chief diplomat parted company over some of the biggest issues of the  how quickly to wind down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan; whether to arm the rebels in Syria; how to respond to the upheaval in Egypt; and whether to trust the Russians. In Landler’s gripping account, we venture inside the Situation Room during the raid on Osama bin Laden’s compound, watch Obama and Clinton work in tandem to salvage a conference on climate change in Copenhagen, and uncover the secret history of their nuclear diplomacy with Iran—a story with a host of fresh disclosures.

With the grand sweep of history and the pointillist detail of an account based on insider access—the book draws on exclusive interviews with more than one hundred senior administration officials, foreign diplomats, and friends of Obama and Clinton—Mark Landler offers the definitive account of a complex, profoundly important relationship.","[""Politics"",""Nonfiction"",""History"",""Biography"",""American History"",""Presidents"",""Us Presidents"",""Political Science""]",6/23/2016,2016.0,"{""name"":""Mark Landler"",""num_books"":2,""num_followers"":""8""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":2,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":16,""reviews_percentage"":3},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":88,""reviews_percentage"":20},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":217,""reviews_percentage"":50},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":111,""reviews_percentage"":25}}","""$13.99""",external,internal_focus,True

Manetsch""]",4.71,118,34.0,"In Calvin's Company of Pastors , Scott Manetsch examines the pastoral theology and practical ministry activities of Geneva's reformed ministers from the time of Calvin's arrival in Geneva until the beginning of the seventeenth century. During these seven decades, more than 130 men were enrolled in Geneva's Venerable Company of Pastors (as it was called), including notable reformed leaders such as Pierre Viret, Theodore Beza, Simon Goulart, Lambert Daneau, and Jean Diodati. Aside from these better-known epigones, Geneva's pastors from this period remain hidden from view, cloaked in Calvin's long shadow, even though they played a strategic role in preserving and reshaping Calvin's pastoral legacy.

Making extensive use of archival materials, published sermons, catechisms, prayer books, personal correspondence, and theological writings, Manetsch offers an engaging and vivid portrait of pastoral life in sixteenth- and early seventeenth-century Geneva, exploring the manner in which Geneva's ministers conceived of their pastoral office and performed their daily responsibilities of preaching, public worship, moral discipline, catechesis, administering the sacraments, and pastoral care. Manetsch demonstrates that Calvin and his colleagues were much more than ivory tower theologians or ""quasi-agents of the state,"" concerned primarily with dispensing theological information to their congregations or enforcing magisterial authority. Rather, they saw themselves as spiritual shepherds of Christ's Church, and this self-understanding shaped to a significant degree their daily work as pastors and preachers.","[""History"",""Church History"",""Theology"",""Christian"",""Christianity"",""Biography"",""Nonfiction"",""Reformation"",""Leadership"",""Ecclesiology""]",1/1/2012,2012.0,"{""name"":""Scott M.

In its coming to inherit the unwanted distinction of being the serial killer capital of not just Canada—but apparently also the world during this dark age in the city’s sordid history— the crimes seen in London over this quarter-century period remain unparalleled and for the most part unsolved. From the earliest documented case of homicidal copycatting in Canada, to the fact that at any given time up to six serial killers were operating at once in the deceivingly serene “Forest City,” London was once a place that on the surface presented a veneer of normality when beneath that surface dark things would whisper and stir. Through it all, a lone detective would go on to spend the rest of his life fighting against impossible odds to protect the city against a tidal wave of violence that few ever saw coming, and which to this day even fewer choose to remember. With his death in 2011, he took these demons to his grave with him but with a twist—a time capsule hidden in his basement, and which he intended to one day be opened. Contained inside: a secret cache of his diaries, reports, photographs, and hunches that might allow a new generation of sleuths to pick up where he left off, carry on his fight, and ultimately bring the killers to justice—killers that in many cases are still out there.

Murder City is an explosive book over fifty years in the making, and is the history of London, Ontario as never told before. Stranger than fiction, tragic, ironic, horrifying, yet also inspiring, this is the true story of one city under siege, and a book that marks a game changer for the true crime genre.","[""True Crime"",""Nonfiction"",""Crime"",""History"",""Canada"",""Mystery"",""Murder Mystery"",""Biography"",""20th Century"",""Cultural""]",6/5/2015,2015.0,"{""name"":""Michael Arntfield"",""num_books"":11,""num_followers"":""51""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":4,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":10,""reviews_percentage"":2},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":73,""reviews_percentage"":20},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":166,""reviews_percentage"":46},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":105,""reviews_percentage"":29}}","""$9.99""",external,external_focus,True

So begins Preachin' the Blues, the biography of American blues signer and guitarist Eddie James ""Son"" House, Jr. (1902 - 1988). House pioneered an innovative style, incorporating strong repetitive rhythms with elements of southern gospel and spiritual vocals. A seminal figure in the history of the Delta blues, he was an important, direct influence on such figures as Muddy Waters and Robert Johnson. The landscape of Son House's life and the vicissitudes he endured make for an absorbing narrative, threaded through with a tension between House's religious beliefs and his spells of commitment to a lifestyle that implicitly rejected it. Drinking, womanizing, and singing the blues caused this tension that is palpable in his music, and becomes explicit in one of his finest performances, ""Preachin' the Blues."" Large parts of House's life are obscure, not least because his own accounts of them were inconsistent. Author Daniel Beaumont offers a chronology/topography of House's youth, taking into account evidence that conflicts sharply with the well-worn fable, and he illuminates the obscurity of House's two decades in Rochester, NY between his departure from Mississippi in the 1940s and his ""rediscovery"" by members of the Folk Revival Movement in 1964. Beaumont gives a detailed and perceptive account of House's primary musical legacy: his recordings for Paramount in 1930 and for the Library of Congress in 1941-42. In the course of his research Beaumont has unearthed not only connections among the many scattered facts and fictions but new information about a rumoured murder in Mississippi, and a charge of manslaughter on Long Island - incidents which bring tragic light upon House's lifelong struggles and self-imposed disappearance, and give trenchant meaning to the moving music of this early blues legend.","[""Music"",""Biography"",""Nonfiction"",""History""]",7/1/2011,2011.0,"{""name"":""Daniel Beaumont"",""num_books"":10}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":0,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":2,""reviews_percentage"":1},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":21,""reviews_percentage"":14},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":71,""reviews_percentage"":50},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":47,""reviews_percentage"":33}}","""$9.99""",external,external_focus,True

Along the way, they demonstrate how the economic structures and cultural flows that shaped a particular form of modern femininity crossed national and imperial boundaries. In so doing, they highlight the gendered dynamics of interwar processes of racial formation, showing how images and ideas of the Modern Girl were used to shore up or critique nationalist and imperial agendas. A mix of collaborative and individually authored chapters, the volume concludes with commentaries by Kathy Peiss, Miriam Silverberg, and Timothy Burke.

يقول القصيبي في معرض حديثه عن الحملة الإعلامية التي وجهتها الولايات المتحدة للسعودية خصوصاً بعد حادثتي تفجير الحادي عشر من أيلول بأنه من الممكن القول أنه وباستثناء مصر أيام قناة السويس، والعراق، أيام احتلال الكويت، لم تتعرض أي دولة في العالم كله لهجوم عنيف مركز من الإعلام الأمريكي (والغربي) يماثل الهجوم الذي تعرضت له المملكة خلال الشهور الماضية. هذا وإن تحليل هذه الحملة يحتاج إلى مجلدات-في بعض الأيام كان هناك أكثر من عشر مقالات تهاجم الملكة موزعة على العواصم الغربية، بل إن تحليل نماذج منها يحتاج إلى مجلد أو أكثر، وقد اكتفى القصيبي في مقالته هذه باستعراض أهم ما تضمنه الهجوم: ""التهم الموجهة إلى المملكة"" والتي انتهى بعد استعراضها إلى القول، بأنه من الواضح، وفي نظره على الأقل، بأن الأجهزة الاستخبارية الأميركية هي التي تقف وراء الحملة، وهناك أكثر من سبب قويّ يدفعها إلى أن تقف هذا الموقف، من ناحية، تنفيذ التفجيرات يوم 11 سبتمبر/أيلول بهذا القدر الكبير من الفعالية يدل على فشل الأجهزة الاستخبارية الأمريكية الذريع وإهمال القاتل (لو حصل شيء مماثل في اليابان لاستقلال رؤساء الأجهزة... أو انتحروا).
وكان من الطبيعي أن تبحث الأجهزة الأمريكية عن كبش فداء تحمّله المسؤولية الكاملة وتقفي نفسها من تبعات الفشل. وكان المملكة كبش الفداء المثالي: كثير من المتورطين سعوديون، والعقل المخطط سعودي، والتمويل جاء من المملكة، إذن فلولا المملكة لما دقت التفجيرات.

هذه النزعة إلى تعليق التبعية في عنق المملكة هي التي دفعت الأجهزة الأمريكية إلى إعلان قوائم المسافرين فور العثور عليها مع أنه يستحيل على قارئها أن يتبين الخاطف من المخطوف. وهذه النزعة هي التي دفعت الأجهزة، بعد ساعات قلائل، إلى أن تعلن أن أسامة بن لادن هو المشتبه الرئيسي دون أن تقدم دليلاً واحداً مقنعاً، أو غير مقنع.

من ناحية ثانية، تحمل الأجهزة الاستخبارية الأمريكية مشاعر سلبية جداً نحو المملكة لأنها لا تلقى فيها الترحاب الذي تلقاه في الدول الصديقة. حتى عندما وقعت تفجيرات في العليّا والخبر، وسقط ضحايا من المواطنين الأمريكيين لم تسمع حكومة المملكة للفريق الأمني الأمريكي باستجواب المتهمين، فضلاً عن تسليمه الملف بأكمله (كما تفعل الدول الصديقة) وهذه الحملة الاستخباراتية سرعان ما وجدت صدى في الكونجرس، وصدرت تصريحات عديدة تحمل النغمة نفسها.؟ ونجحت الأجهزة في إقناع مراكز القرار الرئيسية في واشنطن بوجهة نظرها.

وهكذا يمضي الدكتور القصيبي في تحليلاته البالغة الأهمية، وباستقراءاته المعمقة لواقع السياسة الأمريكية في ظل أحداث الحادي عشر من أيلول وتداعياتها لوضع النقاط على الحروف للهجمة الإعلامية التي تشنها السياسة الأمريكية على المملكة السعودية من خلال إعلامها المُسَيَّسْ.

وتمثل صفحات هذا الكتاب محاولة لفهم هذه الحملة، ولبحث العلاقة التي يراها المؤلف علاقة عضوية بين الإعلام والنظام السياسي. وتبسيطاً للأمور فقد عمد القصيبي في استقراءاته هذه لاستعمال ""الصحافة"" و""الإعلام"" ككلمتين مترادفتين، وقصر حديثه على الإعلام السياسي دون غيره من وجوه الإعلام.

وسطور هذا الكتاب جديرة بقراءة متعمقة تتيح للقارئ، وفي ظل التجاذب السياسي الإعلامي التي تشهده الساحة الإعلامية العربية، هذا التجاذب الذي أحدثته الصناعة الإسرائيلية، بعد الحادي عشر من أيلول، هذه القراءة المتعمّقة تتيح للقارئ إدراك ما خلف كواليس مطابخ إعلام السياسة الدولية بصورة عامة والأمريكية منها بخاصة.","[""Politics"",""Nonfiction""]",1/1/2002,2002.0,"{""name"":""Ghazi A.

Miller""]",3.91,56,3.0,"Slaves to Fashion is a pioneering cultural history of the black dandy, from his emergence in Enlightenment England to his contemporary incarnations in the cosmopolitan art worlds of London and New York. It is populated by sartorial impresarios such as Julius Soubise, a freed slave who sometimes wore diamond-buckled, red-heeled shoes as he circulated through the social scene of eighteenth-century London, and Yinka Shonibare, a prominent Afro-British artist who not only styles himself as a fop but also creates ironic commentaries on black dandyism in his work. Interpreting performances and representations of black dandyism in particular cultural settings and literary and visual texts, Monica L. Miller emphasizes the importance of sartorial style to black identity formation in the Atlantic diaspora.

Dandyism was initially imposed on black men in eighteenth-century England, as the Atlantic slave trade and an emerging culture of conspicuous consumption generated a vogue in dandified black servants. “Luxury slaves” tweaked and reworked their uniforms, and were soon known for their sartorial novelty and sometimes flamboyant personalities. Tracing the history of the black dandy forward to contemporary celebrity incarnations such as Andre 3000 and Sean Combs, Miller explains how black people became arbiters of style and how they have historically used the dandy’s signature tools—clothing, gesture, and wit—to break down limiting identity markers and propose new ways of fashioning political and social possibility in the black Atlantic world. With an aplomb worthy of her iconographic subject, she considers the black dandy in relation to nineteenth-century American literature and drama, W. E. B. Du Bois’s reflections on black masculinity and cultural nationalism, the modernist aesthetics of the Harlem Renaissance, and representations of black cosmopolitanism in contemporary visual art.","[""Fashion"",""Nonfiction"",""History"",""Race"",""LGBT"",""Fashion History"",""Gender and Sexuality"",""Research""]",9/17/2009,2009.0,"{""name"":""Monica L.

Greetings, dear friends. It is our distinct pleasure to partake of your reality once again, and to journey with you for a while on the road to adventure and self-discovery. “What journey?” you may rightly ask, for it may seem that you are traveling in circles, and the idea of a great adventure in your life is a far cry and distant dream from the daily dogma and relentless burdens of living you face. Nonetheless, allow us to accompany you for a while, as companions offering to entertain you and enliven your step as we point out the sites and symbols along the way. We are storytellers extraordinaire, or so we’ve been told, and we too have traveled in seemingly endless circles, so we have much in common. Our destination is the same as yours, for we are you in another version and form of reality, as deeply entrenched and entrapped as you believe yourselves to be. What sort of paradox is this? And who indeed are we, claiming kin to you and yours? And why do we desire to journey with you? Well, these things you must decide for yourselves. We relate great tales and relish a resplendently irreverent good humor, all intended to figure things out, in all due respect, as best we can. We strive to make sense of existence, gathering multidimensional pieces of a puzzle into a form and shape that encompass untold and unrecognized societies. “How can pieces of a puzzle be multidimensional and what is multidimensional anyway?” We can hear your questions now, and we guarantee that you will have many more before the journey is complete. So we ask, may we join you and enter your reality by invitation? For it is through your beckoning and with your permission that we spring forth as a part of your life. Feel into the depths of your being before you respond. Seek inside for an answer, for to invite us into your reality as friends and companions will with certainty confound and change your lives, and perhaps some of you are quite content with where you are. Perhaps you are not really interested in multi-dimensional realities and perceive these ideas as vague notions and tidbits of unfounded fiction, fracturing and fragmenting a logic you paid so dearly to achieve. If that is the case, then you may do well to stop short now, and put our tale aside. Perhaps in another time and place, we will meet again. If, however, we have piqued your curiosity and you feel compelled to continue, so be it. It is best to start with the truth. As a matter of fact—if there is such a thing—it is best to end with the truth as well. “And how about the middle and all along the way?” you may ask. Well, the truth is essential throughout the journey; however, the ongoing paradox invariably involves your point of view. Remember that. Now we are travelers through time, which is the best way to describe us. We call ourselves Pleiadians, though we answer to many names and characters. We are as real as you believe yourselves to be. When we encounter you, we meet ourselves located on a slice of time, poised, as you believe, in a solid physical 3-D world. You fascinate us, and perhaps by the end of our travels and tales, you will be fascinated with yourselves as well.

The Hubble Space Telescope continued to produce an astonishing array of images, but the study of the universe was still fractured into  measuring the universe’s expansion rate, the evolution of galaxies in the early universe, the life and death of stars, the search for extrasolar planets, the quest to understand the nature of the elusive dark matter. So little was understood, still, about so many of the most fundamental questions, foremost among  What was the overall structure of the universe? Why had stars formed into galaxies, and galaxies into massive clusters?

What was needed, thought visionary astronomer Jim Gunn, recently awarded the National Medal of Science, was a massive survey of the sky, a kind of new map of the universe that would be so rich in detail and cover such a wide swath of space, be so grand and bold, that it would allow astronomers to see the big picture in a whole new way. So was born the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, a remarkable undertaking bringing together hundreds of astronomers and launching a new era of supercharged astronomical discovery, an era of “e-science” that has taken astronomy from the lonely mountaintop observatory to the touch of your fingertips.

Critically acclaimed science writer Ann Finkbeiner tells the inside story of the Sloan and how it is revolutionizing astronomy. The Sloan stitched together images of deep space taken over the course of five years, providing a remarkably detailed, three-dimensional map of a vast territory of the universe, all digitized and downloadable for easy searching on a personal computer, and available not only to professional astronomers but to the public as well.

Bringing together for the first time images of many millions of galaxies—including the massive structure known as the Sloan Great Wall of galaxies, never seen before—the Sloan is allowing astronomers and armchair enthusiasts alike to watch the universe grow up, providing so many discoveries at such a fast pace that, as one astronomer said, it’s like drinking out of a fire hose. They are watching galaxies forming and galaxies merging with other galaxies, seeing streams of stars swirling out from galaxies, and forming a new understanding of how the smooth soup of matter that emerged from the Big Bang evolved into the universe as we know it.

Ann Finkbeiner brings the excitement and the extraordinary potential of this new era of astronomy vividly to life and allows all readers to understand how they, too, can become part of the discovery process. A Grand and Bold Thing is vital reading for all.","[""Science"",""Nonfiction"",""Astronomy"",""Physics""]",8/17/2010,2010.0,"{""name"":""Ann Finkbeiner"",""num_books"":5,""num_followers"":""3""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":0,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1,""reviews_percentage"":1},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":22,""reviews_percentage"":31},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":29,""reviews_percentage"":42},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":17,""reviews_percentage"":24}}","""$11.99""",external,external_focus,True

Even his terrible death in London in 1305 can be seen as a victory as it provided inspiration for the continuance of the struggle against English domination.

From time immemorial, women were perceived as having the singular mission of bearing and raising children, says Rowland, who documents the consequences of this view: until the late 19th century, women's rights derived from husbands, fathers and sons. It was believed that their biology made women incapable of thinking rationally—hence they could not own property, vote or work as many hours or for as much pay as men. Nor could they have sex not aimed at procreation without social and legal opprobrium. Rowland documents how a legal ""zone of privacy"" granted men as far back as the 1620s didn't accrue to women until 1965, when the Supreme Court legalized contraception. Drawing on legal and historical sources as well as the Bible, the journals of Meriwether Lewis and Lolita, Rowland covers every imaginable aspect of women's legal lives, up to the present day. This massive and remarkable history is well written in smart yet accessible language and is thus the perfect book for the classroom as well as the family room.

The two became fast friends, even as Elvis turned into the world’s biggest star. In 1964, Elvis invited Jerry to work for him as part of his “Memphis Mafia,” and Jerry soon found himself living with Elvis full-time in a Bel Air mansion and, later, in his own room at Graceland. Over the next thirteen years Jerry would work for Elvis in various capacities—from bodyguard to photo double to co-executive producer on a karate film. But more than anything else he was Elvis’s close friend and confidant: Elvis trusted Jerry with protecting his life when he received death threats, he asked Jerry to drive him and Priscilla to the hospital the day Lisa Marie was born and to accompany him during the famous “lost weekend” when he traveled to meet President Nixon at the White House.  Me and a Guy Named Elvis looks at Presley from a friend’s perspective, offering readers the man rather than the icon—including insights into the creative frustrations that lead to Elvis’s abuse of prescription medicine and his tragic death. Jerry offers never-before-told stories about life inside Elvis’s inner circle and an emotional recounting of the great times, hard times, and unique times he and Elvis shared. These vivid memories will be priceless to Elvis’s millions of fans, and the compelling story will fascinate an even wider audience. BACKCOVER: Advance Praise for Me and a Guy Named Elvis  “This book kept me up late into the night as I turned the pages, reliving every situation and every story as if I were there all over again, until I finished. Jerry Schilling’s words brought tears to my eyes, making me smile and nod as it filled my head with things I had forgotten but thankfully he remembered. Jerry tells his story with the freshness and purity of a man who truly loved his friend. Me and a Guy Named Elvis is not only authentic, honest, and truly moving—it is a marvel.” —Priscilla Presley  “Jerry had the keys to the kingdom, the keys to the King’s houses, to the King’s cars, to the heart of what made Elvis a King in the first place. Here he unlocks every door and his own heart to boot. In this book, Jerry Schilling brings grace to Graceland.” —Bono  “Jerry Schilling has captured the beauty of my father’s spirit in a way that has never been done before. I will admit that I was nervous to read another book on this subject, especially by a friend (there are not many who remain in my life from this time period, as Jerry does), but this book is by far my favorite. It is a captivating, well-written, and un-crucifying account of many historic moments that shows the real birth and evolution of Rock and Roll and how it bridged the racial divide. Jerry tells his story of a young boy growing up poor with no real family before fate changed his life during one Sunday afternoon game of football—and he tells it with humility, honesty, and dignity.” —Lisa Marie Presley  “What Jerry Schilling has written in Me and a Guy Named Elvis is an account of one man’s experience, a personal memoir that, while it places its narrator squarely in the midst of historic events, never claims credit for those events in the way that so many self-serving memoirs are inclined to do. It is a balanced treatment of a complex subject . . . What I think distinguishes the book most of all, though, is its emotional honesty, the generosity of spirit with which Jerry seeks to emulate his friend and mentor.” —Peter Guralnick, author of Last Train to Memphis and Careless Love","[""Biography"",""Music"",""Nonfiction"",""Memoir"",""Biography Memoir"",""Autobiography"",""History"",""Rock N Roll""]",1/1/2006,2006.0,"{""name"":""Jerry Schilling"",""num_books"":3,""num_followers"":""16""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":10,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":29,""reviews_percentage"":1},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":211,""reviews_percentage"":13},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":421,""reviews_percentage"":26},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":903,""reviews_percentage"":57}}","""$9.99""",external,external_focus,True

Da Bears! tells the full story of the ’85 legends—with all the contro­versy and excitement—on the field and off.
 
It’s been 25 years since the Chicago Bears won Super Bowl XX with what Bill Parcells called “the best de­fensive team I’ve ever seen” and an offense surprisingly good for a franchise where offense was often a dirty word. Now, for the first time, an incredibly candid book takes you through all the games and behind the scenes—into the huddles, the locker rooms, the team meetings, and of course the bars—for an intimate ac­count of that unforgettable season.
 
Here’s how a team that got booed in its regular-season opener ended up winning its first world cham­pionship in 22 years, led by the most capable, colorful, and un-PC characters ever to strap on helmets—including Jim McMahon, the hard partyer and so-called punk rocker who became a star quarterback and an antihero; William “Refrigerator” Perry, the rookie giant who turned into a full-blown national sensation; Mike Ditka, the legendarily combative head coach called “Sybil” for his mercurial moods; his nemesis, defensive coordinator, Buddy Ryan, who insulted and broke down his players, then built them back up again, military-style; Walter Payton, the hard-nosed running back and mischievous prankster; and middle linebacker Mike Singletary, known for his leadership and his jarring hits.
 
From the inner workings of their innovative and attacking 46 defense to the inside story of their cocky “Super Bowl Shuffle” music video (shot, amazingly, right after their one loss of the season, to Miami), all the setbacks and triumphs, ferocious hits and foibles, of this once-in-a-lifetime team are recaptured brashly and boldly—the Chicago way.","[""Football"",""Nonfiction"",""Sports"",""History""]",1/1/2010,2010.0,"{""name"":""Steve Delsohn"",""num_books"":17,""num_followers"":""9""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":0,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":6,""reviews_percentage"":3},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":41,""reviews_percentage"":24},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":73,""reviews_percentage"":43},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":48,""reviews_percentage"":28}}","""$12.99""",external,external_focus,True

They argue persuasively that the label is highly politicized and that in the United States it is used by the government, journalists, and academics to brand as evil those nations and political movements that in one way or another interfere with the imperial interests of U.S. capitalism. Thus the word genocide is seldom applied when the perpetrators are U.S. allies (or even the United States itself), while it is used almost indiscriminately when murders are committed or are alleged to have been committed by enemies of the United States and U.S. business interests. One set of rules applies to cases such as U.S. aggression in Vietnam, Israeli oppression of Palestinians, Indonesian slaughter of so-called communists and the people of East Timor, U.S. bombings in Serbia and Kosovo, the U.S. war of liberation in Iraq, and mass murders committed by U.S. allies in Rwanda and the Republic of Congo. Another set applies to cases such as Serbian aggression in Kosovo and Bosnia, killings carried out by U.S. enemies in Rwanda and Darfur, Saddam Hussein, any and all actions by Iran, and a host of others.

With its careful and voluminous documentation, close reading of the U.S. media and political and scholarly writing on the subject, and clear and incisive charts, The Politics of Genocide is both a damning condemnation and stunning expose of a deeply rooted and effective system of propaganda aimed at deceiving the population while promoting the expansion of a cruel and heartless imperial system.

Stein""]",3.89,55,8.0,"The Shakers, once a radical religious sect whose members were despised and harassed by their fellow Americans, have in recent years become celebrated—and sentimentalized—for their communal way of life, the simplicity of their worship, their belief in celibacy, pacifism, and equality of the sexes, and not least, their superb furniture and handicrafts. This monumental book is the first general history of the Shakers from their origins in eighteenth-century England to the present day.

Drawing on written and oral testimony by Shakers over the past two centuries, Stephen J. Stein offers a full and often revisionist account of the movement: their charismatic leaders, the early years in revolutionary New York and New England, the expansion into the West, the maturation and growth of the sect before the Civil War, the decline in their fortunes after the war, the painful adjustments to society Shakers had to make during the first half of the twentieth century, the renaissance of interest after 1950, and the “forbidden topic” within contemporary Shakerism—the conflict between the two remaining villages at Canterbury, New Hampshire, and Sabbathday Lake, Maine. Stein provides many new interpretations of the Shaker experience. He reassesses the role of founder Ann Lee, emphasizes the impact of the western Shaker settlements on the course of the society’s history, and describes the variety of cultural enterprises that have obscured the religious and historical dimensions of the Shakers. Throughout Stein places the Shaker experience within the wider context of American life and shows how the movement has evolved to deal with changing times. Shattering the romantic myth that has been perpetuated about the quaint and peaceful Shakers, Stein portrays a group that is factious, practical, and fully human.","[""History"",""Religion"",""Nonfiction"",""Research"",""Christianity""]",5/27/1992,1992.0,"{""name"":""Stephen J.

Drawing upon four decades of experience developing, owning, and managing properties and on almost thirty years of teaching at the Harvard Business School, William J. Poorvu offers an insider's perspective on how to make smart decisions about real estate.

The real estate “game” is played by people, and it’s the stories of real people that make Poorvu’s introduction to the industry colorful and interesting. You will meet players ranging from real estate moguls to small-scale developers to individual investors in exotic investment instruments. Their stories evolve throughout the book and illustrate how these people—with all their complicated needs, talents, and motives—fit into the larger process and context.

In clear and nontechnical language, Poorvu explains how variables—players, properties, capital markets, and the external environment—come together to influence the shape and outcome of a real estate deal. He explains the time frame for different kinds of real estate investments and walks the reader through the key “periods of play” in the real estate game: concept, commitment, development, operation, reward, and reinvestment.

The Real Estate Game introduces a simple but powerful “back-of-the-envelope” technique for analyzing the financial implications of a potential deal. Using this tool and others, Poorvu shows readers how to use direct investments, syndicates, and REITs to get into the real estate game across a broad range of property types: residential, office, hotel, industrial, and retail.

Offering unique insight into the ways that developers and investors can create value, The Real Estate Game is both a perfect introduction for the novice and an invaluable overview for the experienced professional.","[""Business"",""Finance"",""Nonfiction"",""Economics"",""Personal Development"",""Textbooks""]",9/13/1999,1999.0,"{""name"":""William J.

But for their sisters, wives and daughters the view was very different. The Wordsworths lived at Grasmere, the Coleridges and Southeys twelve miles away at Keswick and the women created a kind of extended family that kept the group together long after the men had ceased to be friends. Based on necessity, it was far from the harmonious rustic idyll of the myth. Dorothy Wordsworth's consuming love for her brother William forced Mary, his wife, to compete for her husband's affections for more than forty years. When Coleridge fell in love with Mary's sister, Sarah Coleridge found herself abandoned with three small children, forced to live on the charity of her brother-in-law Robert Southey. For the daughters, the 'legacy of genius' was equally destructive. Dora Wordsworth was sent to boarding school at four to learn to become 'a useful girl in the family' and was not allowed to marry the man she loved until she was thirty-seven and dying from TB. Her childhood friend, the young Sara Coleridge, had to fight disapproval, domestic conflict, unwanted pregnancy, depression, opium and morphine addiction to carve out a career as a writer and editor of national standing.Their letters and journals form the basis for an illuminating new account of their interconnected lives - their passionate attachments, petty jealousies, the deaths of children, the realities of chronic ill health and barbaric medical practice.

It has been a true counterrevolution, says Pierre Rosanvallon--the end of the age of growing equality launched by the American and French revolutions. And just as significant as the social and economic factors driving this contemporary inequality has been a loss of faith in the ideal of equality itself. An ambitious transatlantic history of the struggles that, for two centuries, put political and economic equality at their heart, ""The Society of Equals"" calls for a new philosophy of social relations to reenergize egalitarian politics.

For eighteenth-century revolutionaries, equality meant understanding human beings as fundamentally alike and then creating universal political and economic rights. Rosanvallon sees the roots of today's crisis in the period 1830-1900, when industrialized capitalism threatened to quash these aspirations. By the early twentieth century, progressive forces had begun to rectify some imbalances of the Gilded Age, and the modern welfare state gradually emerged from Depression-era reforms. But new economic shocks in the 1970s began a slide toward inequality that has only gained momentum in the decades since.

There is no returning to the days of the redistributive welfare state, Rosanvallon says. Rather than resort to outdated notions of social solidarity, we must instead revitalize the idea of equality according to principles of singularity, reciprocity, and communality that more accurately reflect today's realities.","[""Philosophy"",""Sociology"",""Nonfiction"",""Politics"",""History"",""Economics""]",1/1/2011,2011.0,"{""name"":""Pierre Rosanvallon"",""num_books"":73,""num_followers"":""45""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":0,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":3,""reviews_percentage"":3},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":14,""reviews_percentage"":16},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":44,""reviews_percentage"":51},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":25,""reviews_percentage"":29}}","""$13.20""",external,internal_focus,True

If you've ever wondered what is really going on inside your dog's head, here is your chance to find out. In this revised and updated version of this perennially popular book, psychologist and prizewinning trainer Stanley Coren provides a startling view of the intelligence of our oldest and closest animal companions.

Do dogs really think? Are they conscious in the same way humans are? What is the nature of canine memory? Can dogs communicate with us -- and, if so, how can we understand them? Do they have feelings such as guilt, loyalty, and jealousy? Do they experience joy and sorrow?

Drawing on scientific research that has stood the test of the past decade, interviews with top breeders and trainers, and his own personal observations as a lifelong dog lover, Stanley Coren speculates on these and many other fascinating questions about man's best friend. He offers practical tips on how to evaluate your dog's body language and understand the sophisticated ""language"" of a dog's bark, and how to tailor a training program to suit your dog's special needs. Here, too, are the famous, controversial lists and rankings of more than 100 breeds for obedience and working intelligence, as well as for specialized tasks such as hunting, home security, and companionship.

In reinterpreting the crack story, it offers new understandings of both drug addiction and drug prohibition. It shows how crack use arose in the face of growing unemployment, poverty, racism, and shrinking social services. It places crack in its historical context―as the latest in a long line of demonized drugs―and it examines the crack scare as a phenomenon in its own right. Most important, it uses crack and the crack scare as windows onto America's larger drug and drug policy problems.

Written by a team of veteran drug researchers in medicine, law, and the social sciences, this book provides the most comprehensive, penetrating, and original analysis of the crack problem to date. It reviews the social pharmacology of crack and offers rich ethnographic case studies of crack binging, addiction, and sales. It explores crack's different impacts on whites, blacks, the middle class, and the poor, and explains why crack was always much less of a problem in other countries such as Canada, Australia, and The Netherlands.

Crack in America helps readers understand why the United States has the most repressive, expensive, and yet least effective drug policy in the Western world. It discusses the ways politicians and the media generated the crack scare as the centerpiece of the War on Drugs. It catalogues the costs of the War on Drugs for civil liberties, situates crack use and sales in the political economy of the inner cities in the 1980s, and shows how the drug war led to the most massive wave of imprisonment in U.S. history. Finally, it explains why the failures of drug prohibition have led to the emergence of the harm reduction movement and other opposition forces that are changing the face of U.S. drug policy.","[""Politics"",""Nonfiction""]",8/2/1997,1997.0,"{""name"":""Craig Reinarman"",""num_books"":9,""num_followers"":""1""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":2,""reviews_percentage"":3},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":18,""reviews_percentage"":33},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":18,""reviews_percentage"":33},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":15,""reviews_percentage"":27}}",,external,external_focus,True

The Triumphant Years takes up the artist’s life in 1917, when Picasso and Cocteau left wartime Paris for Rome to work with Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes on their revolutionary production of Parade . Visits to Naples, above all to the Farnese marbles in the Museo Nazionale, would leave Picasso with a lifelong obsession with classical sculpture as well as the self-referential commedia dell’arte. After returning to Paris and marrying one of Diaghilev’s ballerinas, Olga Khokhlova, he abandoned bohemia for the drawing rooms of Paris. Hence, his so-called Duchess period, which coincided with his switch to neoclassicism, and would ultimately be absorbed into a metamorphic form of cubism.

In the summer of 1923, Picasso and his American friends Gerald and Sara Murphy transformed the French Riviera from a winter into a summer resort, when they persuaded the proprietor of the Hôtel du Cap at Antibes to keep the place open for the summer. In doing so, they made the Riviera Europe’s major playground. Mediterraneanism was in Picasso’s bones. Born in Málaga, he would always identify with this inland sea.

In 1927 the artist’s life underwent a major change; he abandoned society for a life out of the spotlight with a beautiful seventeen-year-old girl, Marie-Thérèse Walter. His erotic obsession with Marie-Thérèse would result in an ever-growing antipathy for his neurasthenic, understandably jealous wife. Balletic clues have enabled Richardson to identify a number of baffling figure-paintings as portrayals of Olga and reinterpret the work of the late 1920s and early 1930s. Picasso’s passionate love for his mistress and his passionate hatred for his wife can be fully understood only in light of each other.

The last three chapters constitute an annus mirabilis—spring 1931 to spring 1932—during which the artist celebrated his fiftieth birthday. Challenged to scale new heights by the passage of time, Picasso lived up to his shamanic belief that painting should have a magic function. In the course of this year, he reinvented sculpture and to a great extent his own imagery in a bid to Picassify the classical tradition. The resultant retrospective in Paris and Zurich in the summer of 1932 confirmed Picasso as the leader of the modern movement.","[""Art"",""Biography"",""Nonfiction"",""Art History"",""History"",""France"",""Spain""]",11/1/2007,2007.0,"{""name"":""John     Richardson"",""num_books"":36,""num_followers"":""60""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":9,""reviews_percentage"":2},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":45,""reviews_percentage"":14},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":116,""reviews_percentage"":37},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":139,""reviews_percentage"":44}}","""$21.99""",external,external_focus,True

In the course of that career, he learned countless lessons about our interspecies turf wars with infectious agents. Called in to contain an outbreak of deadly hemorrhagic fever in Bolivia, he confronted the despair of trying to save a colleague who accidentally infected himself with an errant scalpel. Working in Level 4 labs on the Machupo and Ebola viruses, he saw time and again why expensive high-tech biohazard containment equipment is only as safe as the people who use it.   Because of new, emerging viruses, and the return of old, “vanquished” ones for which vaccines do not exist, there remains a very real danger of a new epidemic that could, without proper surveillance and early intervention, spread worldwide virtually overnight. And the possibility of foreign countries or terrorist groups using deadly airborne viruses—the poor man’s nuclear arsenal—looms larger than ever.   High-octane science writing at its best and most revealing, Virus Hunter is a thrilling first-person account of what it is like to be a warrior in the Hot Zone.","[""Science"",""Nonfiction"",""Medicine"",""Medical"",""History"",""Memoir"",""Biography"",""Biology"",""Health"",""Disease""]",4/14/1997,1997.0,"{""name"":""C.J.

In this stunning new biography of Vita Sackville-West, Matthew Dennison's Behind the Mask traces the triumph and contradictions of Vita's extraordinary life. His narrative charts a fascinating course from Vita's lonely childhood at Knole, through her affectionate but ‘open' marriage to Harold Nicolson (during which both husband and wife energetically pursued homosexual affairs, Vita most famously with Virginia Woolf), and through Vita's literary successes and disappointments, to the famous gardens the couple created at Sissinghurst. The book tells how, from her privileged world of the aristocracy, Sackville-West brought her penchant for costume, play-acting and rebellion to the artistic vanguard of modern Britain. Dennison is the acclaimed author of many books including a biography of Queen Victoria.
Here, in the first biography to be written of Vita for thirty years, he reveals the whole story and gets behind ‘the beautiful mask' of Vita's public achievements to reveal an often troubled persona which heroically resisted compromise on every level. Drawing on wideranging sources and the extensive letters that sustained her marriage, this is a compelling story of love, loss and jealousy, of high-life and low points, of binding affection and illicit passion – a portrait of an extraordinary, 20th-century life.","[""Biography"",""Nonfiction"",""History"",""LGBT"",""Biography Memoir"",""British Literature"",""Writing"",""Audiobook"",""Queer""]",10/9/2014,2014.0,"{""name"":""Matthew Dennison"",""num_books"":44,""num_followers"":""62""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":12,""reviews_percentage"":5},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":22,""reviews_percentage"":10},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":73,""reviews_percentage"":34},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":76,""reviews_percentage"":35},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":31,""reviews_percentage"":14}}","""$11.99""",external,external_focus,False

The successful creation of the Constitution is a suspense story. The Summer of 1787 takes us into the sweltering room in which delegates struggled for four months to produce the flawed but enduring document that would define the nation -- then and now.   George Washington presided, James Madison kept the notes, Benjamin Franklin offered wisdom and humor at crucial times. The Summer of 1787 traces the struggles within the Philadelphia Convention as the delegates hammered out the charter for the world's first constitutional democracy. Relying on the words of the delegates themselves to explore the Convention's sharp conflicts and hard bargaining, David O. Stewart lays out the passions and contradictions of the often painful process of writing the Constitution.   It was a desperate balancing act. Revolutionary principles required that the people have power, but could the people be trusted? Would a stronger central government leave room for the states? Would the small states accept a Congress in which seats were alloted according to population rather than to each sovereign state? And what of slavery? The supercharged debates over America's original sin led to the most creative and most disappointing political deals of the Convention.   The room was crowded with colorful and passionate characters, some known -- Alexander Hamilton, Gouverneur Morris, Edmund Randolph -- and others largely forgotten. At different points during that sultry summer, more than half of the delegates threatened to walk out, and some actually did, but Washington's quiet leadership and the delegates' inspired compromises held the Convention together.   In a country continually arguing over the document's original intent, it is fascinating to watch these powerful characters struggle toward consensus -- often reluctantly -- to write a flawed but living and breathing document that could evolve with the nation.

Langer""]",4.11,272,23.0," Modern theories of meaning usually culminate in a critique of science. This book presents a study of human intelligence beginning with a semantic theory and leading into a critique of music.  By implication it sets up a theory of all the arts; the transference of its basic concepts to other arts than music is not developed, but it is sketched, mainly in the chapter on artistic import. Thoughtful readers of the original edition discovered these far-reaching ideas quickly enough as the career of the book shows: it is as applicable to literature, art and music as to the field of philosophy itself.  The topics it deals with are many: language, sacrament, myth, music, abstraction, fact, knowledge--to name only the main ones. But through them all goes the principal theme, symbolic transformation as the essential activity of human minds. This central idea, emphasizing as it does the notion of symbolism, brings Mrs. Langer's book into line with the prevailing interest in semantics. All profound issues of our age seem to center around the basic concepts of symbolism and meaning. The formative, creative, articulating power of symbols is the tonic chord which thinkers of all schools and many diverse fields are unmistakably striking; the surprising, far-reaching implications of this new fundamental conception constitute what Mrs. Langer has called ""philosophy in a new key.""  Mrs. Langer's book brings the discussion of symbolism into a wider general use than criticism of word meaning. Her volume is vigorous, effective, and well written and will appeal to everyone interested in the contemporary problems of philosophy.

But as Shane O’Mara writes in this account of the human brain under stress, another reason torture should never be condoned is because it does not work the way torturers assume it does.

In countless films and TV shows such as Homeland and 24, torture is portrayed as a harsh necessity. If cruelty can extract secrets that will save lives, so be it. CIA officers and others conducted torture using precisely this justification. But does torture accomplish what its defenders say it does? For ethical reasons, there are no scientific studies of torture. But neuroscientists know a lot about how the brain reacts to fear, extreme temperatures, starvation, thirst, sleep deprivation, and immersion in freezing water, all tools of the torturer’s trade. These stressors create problems for memory, mood, and thinking, and sufferers predictably produce information that is deeply unreliable—and, for intelligence purposes, even counterproductive. As O’Mara guides us through the neuroscience of suffering, he reveals the brain to be much more complex than the brute calculations of torturers have allowed, and he points the way to a humane approach to interrogation, founded in the science of brain and behavior.

Torture may be effective in forcing confessions, as in Stalin’s Russia. But if we want information that we can depend on to save lives, O’Mara writes, our model should be Napoleon: “It has always been recognized that this way of interrogating men, by putting them to torture, produces nothing worthwhile.”","[""Psychology"",""Nonfiction"",""Science"",""Politics"",""War"",""Neuroscience"",""History""]",11/11/2015,2015.0,"{""name"":""Shane O'Mara"",""num_books"":9,""num_followers"":""44""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1,""reviews_percentage"":1},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":2,""reviews_percentage"":2},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":11,""reviews_percentage"":14},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":30,""reviews_percentage"":39},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":32,""reviews_percentage"":42}}","""$27.99""",external,external_focus,True

He repeatedly spoke of the ways in which recorded music was antithetical to his work. In Records Ruin the Landscape , David Grubbs argues that, following Cage, new genres in experimental and avant-garde music in the 1960s were particularly ill suited to be represented in the form of a recording. These activities include indeterminate music, long-duration minimalism, text scores, happenings, live electronic music, free jazz, and free improvisation. How could these proudly evanescent performance practices have been adequately represented on an LP?

In their day, few of these works circulated in recorded form. By contrast, contemporary listeners can encounter this music not only through a flood of LP and CD releases of archival recordings but also in even greater volume through Internet file sharing and online resources. Present-day listeners are coming to know that era's experimental music through the recorded artifacts of composers and musicians who largely disavowed recordings. In Records Ruin the Landscape , Grubbs surveys a musical landscape marked by altered listening practices.","[""Music"",""Art"",""Nonfiction"",""History""]",1/1/2014,2014.0,"{""name"":""David Grubbs"",""num_books"":12,""num_followers"":""13""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":0,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":3,""reviews_percentage"":2},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":34,""reviews_percentage"":28},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":61,""reviews_percentage"":50},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":22,""reviews_percentage"":18}}","""$14.55""",external,external_focus,True
